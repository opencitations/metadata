acid as the sole carbon and energy source was isolated from a soil used for
grown wheat with a long-term history of herbicide use in Beijing, China. The
strain BJ71 was identified as <italic>Cupriavidus campinensis</italic> based on
its 16S rRNA sequence analysis and morphological, physiological, and biochemical
characteristics. The degradation characteristics of strain BJ71 were evaluated.
The optimal conditions for 2,4-D degradation were as follows: pH 7.0, 30 &#x000b0;C, 3%
(v/v) inoculum size, and an initial 2,4-D concentration of 350 mg
L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Up to 99.57% of the 2,4-D was degraded under optimal conditions
after 6 days of incubation. Strain BJ71 was also able to degrade quizalofop and
fluroxypyr. This is the first report of a 2,4-D-degrader containing
<italic>tfdA</italic> gene that can utilize these two herbicides. In a
biodegradation experiment, 87.13% and 42.53% of 2,4-D (initial concentration,
350 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was degraded in non-sterile and sterilized soil
inoculated with BJ71, respectively, after 14 days. The 2,4-D degradation was
more rapid in a soil microcosm including BJ71 than in a soil microcosm without
BJ71. These results indicate that strain BJ71 is a potential candidate for the
bioremediation of soil contaminated with the herbicide 2,4-D.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>2,4-D-degrading bacterial strain</kwd><kwd>bioremediation</kwd><kwd><italic>Cupriavidus campinensis</italic> BJ71</kwd><kwd>degradation characteristics</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The post-emergence systemic herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) has been
widely used to control dicotyledonous weeds in cereal and grass crops for more than
60 years. Although this herbicide has a short half-life in soil and aquatic
environments, its extensive use is a cause for concern because of the potential
threat to the environment and human health (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">Chinalia
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The WHO (World Health Organization)
has classified 2,4-D as a hormonal herbicide with level II toxicity. It is
considered to be a carcinogenic agent affecting the liver and heart. It also affects
the central nervous system, leading to convulsions (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">Garc'a <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Maloney and Waxman, 1999</xref>). Because of the relatively high water
solubility and low soil-absorption coefficient of the free acid of 2,4-D, it often
contaminates the environment when it enters streams, rivers, or lakes after drainage
of agricultural lands (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">Chinalia and Killham,
2006</xref>; <xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">El-Bestawy and Hans-Jorgen,
2007</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lane, 1991</xref>). Most of the
2,4-D-degrading bacteria characterized to date are members of genera belonging to
the &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subdivisions of the class Proteobacteria, and have been isolated from
2,4-D-treated environments (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kamagata
<italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lee
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The best-described pathway for 2,4-D
degradation is the plasmid-encoded pathway of the bacterium <italic>Ralstonia
eutropha</italic> (formerly <italic>Alcaligenes eutrophus</italic>,
<italic>Waustersia eutropha</italic>) strain JMP134 (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Fukumori and Hausinger, 1993a</xref>; <xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">Fukumori and Hausinger, 1993b</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Streber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>). Despite the many
attempts to increase the biodegradation of 2,4-D by bioaugmentation of soils with
degrading strains, no significant increases in pollutant removal compared with that
in uninoculated soil have been achieved (S&#x000e1;nchez <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994). The
introduced strains do not always survive well in the soil environment because of
various stresses, including competition with indigenous microorganisms (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Manzano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Marr&#x000f3;n-Montiel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).
For successful bioremediation of herbicide-contaminated soil, it is necessary to
construct a unique niche for the desired microbes so that they can be productively
exploited (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2008</xref>). Hence, the use of
native 2,4-D degrading microorganisms is a feasible strategy for the bioremediation
of polluted sites. The purpose of this study was to isolate an indigenous 2,4-D
degrading strain using enrichment techniques, and to evaluate the degradation
characteristics of the strain under different conditions. Our long-term goal is to
isolate and characterize an indigenous 2,4-D degrading strain for bioaugmentation
during <italic>in situ</italic> clean-up of sites polluted with 2,4-D in China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>2,4-D, 2-methyl-4-chloro-phenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), mecoprop (99% purity), and

supplemented with 500 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 2,4-D as the sole carbon and energy
source. The flasks were incubated at 30 &#x000b0;C for 7 days in a rotary shaker at 150

to 100 mL fresh MSM containing 500 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 2,4-D and further incubated
for 7 days. Four rounds of enrichment were performed and the final enrichment
cultures were serially diluted and spread on MSM plates containing 500 mg
L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 2,4-D. After incubation at 30 &#x000b0;C for 4 days, single colonies
with different morphologies were selected for further analysis of their
degradation abilities. For each strain, the extent of degradation was determined
by quantifying the amount of 2,4-D remaining in the culture by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). One strain isolated from Beijing, designated as
BJ71, degraded 2,4-D very quickly and showed the highest degradation rate of
2,4-D among the isolated strains. This strain was selected for further
investigation. Isolates were stored frozen in 15% glycerol at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until

Microscopic observation was performed with an HITACHI S3400N scanning electron
microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 20 kV. Samples were prepared for scanning
electron microscopy by fixing bacterial colonies in 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution
with SEMpore (Hitachi). The samples were lyophilized and coated with gold prior
to microscopic observations. Total genomic DNA was extracted with an E.Z.N.A.
Bacterial DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Doraville, GA, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified from the
extracted genomic DNA using the universal primers 27f
(5&#x02032;-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3&#x02032;) and 1492r (5&#x02032;-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3&#x02032;) as
described previously (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lane, 1991</xref>). Each
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixture contained 1 &#x000d7; Premix Taq (Ex Taq
Version, Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan), 0.4 &#x003bc;M each primer, and ~50 ng template DNA.
The PCR amplification conditions were as follows: 95 &#x000b0;C for 5 min; followed by
35 cycles of 95 &#x000b0;C for 45 s, 55 &#x000b0;C for 45 s, and 72 &#x000b0;C for 90 s. To ensure
complete elongation, a final step of 72 &#x000b0;C for 7 min was performed. Reactions
were performed in a MyCycler Thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR
products were sequenced by Takara (Dalian, China). The identification of
phylogenetic neighbors was initially carried out using the BLASTN program
against the database containing type strains with valid published prokaryotic

manner as described above. Culture samples were extracted at 24-h intervals to
measure cell growth and the amount of 2,4-D remaining, as described below. We
examined the effects of initial 2,4-D concentration (200, 350, 500, 650, and 800

(1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10%), medium pH (5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0), and
liquid medium volume (50, 100, 120, 150 mL) on cell growth and 2,4-D

growth was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the sample at 420 nm using
a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Smejkal

Strain BJ71 degraded 2,4-D quickly at low substrate concentrations (200 and 350
mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and showed almost complete degradation of 200 mg
L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 2,4-D in 3 days. When the initial 2,4-D concentration was 350
mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, BJ71 degraded 90% of the 2,4-D after 4 days. BJ71 was also
able to degrade 2,4-D at high concentrations in MSM (94.08% of 500 mg
L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 61% of 800 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 7 days of incubation).
We also investigated the effects of other factors on the 2,4-D degradation rate
of strain BJ71 (<xref rid="f04" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Among six
different pHs, pH 7.0 was optimal for 2,4-D degradation by BJ71. This strain was
well-adapted to a wide range of pHs and was able to degrade up to 40% of the
2,4-D at pH 5.0&#x02013;10.0. Temperature is a major environmental factor affecting
degradation. The biodegradation rate was approximately 8.49% at the highest
temperature tested (34 &#x000b0;C), and 98.98% at 30 &#x000b0;C. The optimum inoculum size was
3.0%. The degradation rate decreased when the inoculum size was too low or too
high because of insufficient inoculum or nutrient limitation, respectively.
There was no significant effect of different medium volumes on the 2,4-D
degradation rate.</p><fig id="f03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effect of initial 2,4-D concentration on degradation of 2,4-D by

several other herbicides including mecoprop, MCPA, quizalofop, and fluroxypyr.
After 4 days of incubation, dark violet colonies were observed on the plates of
Modified Loos medium containing 2,4-D, quizalofop and fluroxypyr. Therefore,
BJ71 was able to grow on media containing the herbicides quizalofop and

with and without strain BJ71 (<xref rid="f06" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).
In non-sterile soil inoculated with strain BJ71, the degradation rate was
markedly higher than in the other treatments after 42 days of incubation at 30
&#x000b0;C. After 14 days of incubation, 87.13% and 42.53% of 2,4-D (initial
concentration of 350 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were degraded in non-sterile and
sterilized soil inoculated with the strain BJ71, respectively. In non-sterile
control without strain BJ71, the removal rate was only 7.34%. There was no
degradation of 2,4-D in control sterilized soil, which contained 350 mg
kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 2,4-D but no inoculant (data not shown). The decrease in
2,4-D concentrations in soil lacking BJ71 indicated that other indigenous
microorganisms showed some 2,4-D degrading ability. Strain BJ71 enhanced the
degradation of 2,4-D when present with other indigenous microorganisms in the
soil. The isolated <italic>C. campinensis</italic> BJ71 strain has been

wheat field in Beijing, China. The strain was identified as <italic>C.
campinensis</italic> based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and its
physiological features. In previous studies, several types of 2,4-D-degrading
bacteria were isolated from 2,4-D-treated environments. These bacteria have been
categorized into three groups based on their degradation enzymes and physiological
properties. The first group consists of copiotrophic bacteria belonging to the &#x003b2; and
&#x003b3; subdivisions of the class Proteobacteria, and includes species in the genera
<italic>Achromobacter</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia</italic>,
<italic>Delftia</italic>, <italic>Halomonas</italic>,
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Ralstonia</italic>,
<italic>Rhodoferax</italic>, and <italic>Variovorax</italic>. Their
2,4-D-catabolizing enzymes are encoded by genes homologous to <italic>tfdA</italic>,
which encodes an Fe(II)/&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that converts 2,4-D
into 2,4-dichlorophenol. The <italic>tfdA</italic> gene is initially found in
<italic>R. eutropha</italic> JMP134 (Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic>, 201;

strains, which include <italic>Delftia acidovorans</italic> MC1,
<italic>Rhodoferax</italic> sp. P230, and <italic>Sphingobium

previous studies. The degradation capacity of strain BJ71 was greater than those
reported for <italic>Sphingomonas agrestis</italic> strain 58-1 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Shimojo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and three other
strains; <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> DS-1, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>
sp. DS-2, and <italic>Sphingomonas paucimobilis</italic> DS-3 (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Cycon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The 2,4-D
degradation ability of strain BJ71 in medium containing 2,4-D was comparable to
those reported for <italic>C. pampae</italic> CPDB6<sup>T</sup> (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Cuadrado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and
<italic>Halomonadaceae</italic> sp. I-18 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Maltseva <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). The 2,4-D degradation
efficiency of strain BJ71 was greater than that of <italic>C. necator</italic>
JMP134, the most intensively studied chloroaromatic-degrading microorganism to date.
When grown on medium containing 250 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of 2,4-D as the sole carbon
and energy source, JMP134 showed a maximum 2,4-D degradation rate of 70% after 10
days of incubation (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lerch <italic>et al.</italic>,
2007</xref>). A <italic>Delftia</italic> species isolated from a polluted river
in Argentina was able to degrade 200 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of 2,4-D in 28 h and remove
99.0% of the pollutant, whereas <italic>C. necator</italic> EMA-G isolated from
agricultural soil in Argentina degraded 250 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 2,4-D in less than 1
day (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gonzale <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>;
<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zabaloy and G&#x000f3;mez, 2013</xref>). <italic>B.
cepacia</italic> YK-2 and a strain of <italic>P. putida</italic> isolated from
the Jordan Valley completely degraded 500 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 2,4-D within 28 and 45
h, respectively (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">Cho <italic>et al.</italic>,

degradation efficiency of these strains in shaking culture with higher
concentrations of 2,4-D or in soil microcosms was not reported. In this study, BJ71
in liquid culture showed a degradation rate of up to 60% after 7 days of incubation
when grown on medium containing 800 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 2,4-D.</p><p>Many 2,4-D-degrading strains do not have wide substrate specificity for
chlorophenoxyalkanoic herbicides, and are limited to 2,4-D as a growth substrate
(<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>;
<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ka <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). We
screened an expanded set of structurally related herbicides, and unexpectedly found
that this 2,4-D-degrading <italic>C. campinensis</italic> BJ71 strain could also
degrade quizalofop and fluroxypyr. The mechanism of action of these herbicides is
entirely different from that of 2,4-D. Quizalofop is in the aryloxyphenoxypropionate
(AOPP) class of potent grass-selective herbicides, and fluroxypyr consists of
pyridyloxyacetate compounds. <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Wright <italic>et
al.</italic> (2010)</xref> reported that AAD-1 (synonymous with RdpA in
<italic>S. herbicidivorans</italic>) has the unique ability to
enantioselectively cleave R-quizalofop, and that AAD-12, (synonymous with SdpA from
<italic>D. acidovorans</italic>) can degrade fluroxypyr. However, there have
been no other reports in the literature of 2,4-D-degraders containing the
<italic>tfdA</italic> gene that are able to degrade fluroxypyr and quizalofop.
Recently, we cloned the entire <italic>tfdA</italic> gene of <italic>C.
campinensis</italic> strain BJ71 (GenBank accession number: KJ028765). The
sequence of the <italic>tfdA</italic> gene from <italic>C. campinensis</italic> BJ71
shows some differences from that of <italic>C. necator</italic> JMP134 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). To our
knowledge, this is the first report of a 2,4-D degrader containing the
<italic>tfdA</italic> that can degrade several different synthetic auxins
(2,4-D, fluroxypyr, and the aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicide quizalofop). Because
of these characteristics, this strain has great potential for bioremediation of
these herbicides in polluted environments.</p><p>For successful bioremediation, it is important to identify and isolate appropriate
microbial strains, and to ensure their survival and activity after their release
into the target habitat. A key factor in the failure of bioaugmentation strategies
is the rapid decline of the population of introduced cells. The introduced strain
may face intense competition, predation, or parasitism in the natural environment.
The most suitable candidate for bioaugmentation is an autochthonous strain that is
able to survive long-term in the target habitat, and continuously degrade the
contaminant (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Ramos <italic>et al.</italic>,
1991</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Thompson <italic>et al.</italic>,
2005</xref>). It has been reported that the batch culture method used to enrich
and isolate bacteria is highly selective for fast-growing copiotrophic microbes, and
that the isolation of <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> sp. from the most dilute positive
MPN tubes may reflect its dominance in the 2,4-D degrading community in soil (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Macur <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zabaloy and G&#x000f3;mez, 2013</xref>). Our results show that
<italic>Cupriavidus</italic> sp. BJ71, isolated from a polluted wheat field in
China, can rapidly degrade 2,4-D in liquid medium. The biodegradation of 2,4-D was
much more rapid in 2,4-D (350 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)-treated soil inoculated with BJ71
than in soil without this strain. These results suggest that <italic>C.
campinensis</italic> BJ71 could be a suitable candidate for bioaugmentation for
<italic>in situ</italic> clean-up strategies. Because it is an indigenous
organism, it is more likely to survive than are other non-indigenous bacteria when
introduced into polluted soil and water environments in China.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the Foundation of the National Transgenic Major Project of
