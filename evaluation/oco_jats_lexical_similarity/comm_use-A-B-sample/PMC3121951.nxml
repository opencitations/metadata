The mechanism(s) by which resident bone cells respond to their strain environment is complex and involves the activation of a number of signalling pathways including the canonical Wnt pathway, prostaglandins, nitric oxide, extracellular signal-related kinases and oestrogen receptor-&#x003b1; <xref rid="bb0005 bb0010 bb0015 bb0020 bb0025 bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[1&#x02013;6]</xref>.</p><p>The involvement of the Wnt pathway in strain-related regulation of bone architecture was predicted from the discovery that two unrelated families of Caucasian origin, with bones of essentially normal appearance but BMD z scores ranging from 4 to 7, had an autosomal dominant mutation mapped to the gene for the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (<italic>Lrp5</italic>) <xref rid="bb0035 bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[7,8]</xref>. It is through the Lrp5/Frizzled co-receptor that extracellular Wnts activate the Wnt pathway. Discovery of this association between mutation of the <italic>Lrp5</italic> gene and high bone mass occurred around the same time as the realisation that osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG), a rare autosomal recessive condition characterised by low bone mass, was associated with a loss of function mutation in the same <italic>Lrp5</italic> gene <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. An explanation for the skeletal phenotype of both these groups could be that the osteoregulatory effects of mechanical strain influence Wnt signalling through the Lrp5 receptor. This explanation envisages the low bone mass in OPPG patients being due to inadequate strain-related stimulation of the Wnt pathway resulting from failure of Wnt stimulation at the Lrp5 receptor <xref rid="bb0040 bb0045 bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[8&#x02013;10]</xref>. The high bone mass (HBM) in people with the <italic>Lrp5</italic> mutation could be explained as being due to an exaggerated response to strain-related stimulation at the same receptor <xref rid="bb0040 bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[8,10]</xref>.</p><p>A potential mechanism for this hypothetical link between the osteogenic effects of strain and the Wnt pathway became evident with reports that sclerostin was a ligand for the Lrp5 receptor <xref rid="bb0055 bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[11,12]</xref>. Sclerostin, the protein product of the <italic>SOST</italic> gene predominately expressed in osteocytes, is down-regulated by high local mechanical strain <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>SOST</italic> expression is up-regulated in the absence of loading <xref rid="bb0015 bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[3,13]</xref>. Thus in normal individuals high strains would act to depress sclerostin production allowing increased activity of the Wnt/Lrp5 pathway and enhanced bone formation. Low strains would be associated with high levels of sclerostin which would down-regulate activity of the Wnt/Lrp5 pathway with subsequent reduced bone formation. This could be one of the ways in which functional strains influence bone mass.</p><p>Experiments on mice have shown that animals with the <italic>Lrp5</italic> G171V HBM mutation recapitulate the HBM phenotype found in humans <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Those with the <italic>Lrp5</italic> loss of function mutation also have a low bone mass phenotype similar to humans with OPPG <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Sawakami et al. (2006) report that the osteogenic response to mechanical load is significantly lower in male and female mice with the <italic>Lrp5</italic> loss of function mutation (<italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>) compared with Wild Type (<italic>WT</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>) controls <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, while Akhter et al. (2004) report that load-induced cortical bone formation is higher in female mice heterozygous for the <italic>Lrp5</italic> Gl71V HBM mutation (<italic>Lrp5<sup>HBM+</sup></italic>) than in their WT (<italic>WT<sup>HBM&#x02212;</sup></italic>) controls <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Both of these reports are consistent with the hypothesis that Lrp5/Wnt signalling is involved in the osteoregulatory response of cortical bone to mechanical loading.</p><p>Both Sawakami et al. and Akhter et al. performed their experiments using the axially loadable ulna technique originally developed in the rat by Torrance et al. <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> but now routinely applied to the mouse <xref rid="bb0015 bb0080 bb0095 bb0100 bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[3,16,19&#x02013;21]</xref>. One disadvantage of using the ulna is that it does not allow examination of loading-related effects on (re)modelling in trabecular bone. Another disadvantage is that it is not easy experimentally to induce disuse in the front limb and to assess the effects of removal of normal functional loading. To avoid both these disadvantages we used the axially loadable tibia technique <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and applied different load magnitudes to the tibias of male and female mice, either expressing the <italic>Lrp5</italic> G171V HBM mutation <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> or the <italic>Lrp5</italic> loss of function <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and their respective WT controls. In addition to examining the osteogenic effect of additional loading at different magnitudes we also examined the effect of disuse which we imposed by unilateral sciatic neurectomy. By these means we compared the responses in bones of mice of both genders to 1) the degree of bone loss when functional loading is removed &#x02014; which could represent the degree of elevation of bone mass from basal (genetically determined) levels due to normal functional loading; and 2) the increment of loading-related new bone stimulated per unit of strain to which they were exposed &#x02014; which is a measure of their responsiveness to strain. Our hypothesis was that high responsiveness to loading would be associated with increased bone loss due to disuse and a steep &#x0201c;responsiveness&#x0201d; curve between strain magnitude and the increase in new bone formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Animal model</title><p>Two mouse colonies were used, one which expressed the G171V HBM mutation to the <italic>Lrp5</italic> gene, the other <italic>Lrp5</italic> knock-outs lacking any <italic>Lrp5</italic> activity.

We did this by comparing the tibial response to increased magnitudes of strain, and to disuse, in males and females from two groups of mice: those that lack a functional <italic>Lrp5</italic> receptor (<italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>) and those that express the human <italic>Lrp5</italic> G171V gain of function mutation (<italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>HBM+</italic></sup>). The overall inferences from the study are that lack of <italic>Lrp5</italic> function i) has no influence on the amount of disuse-related bone loss in cortical bone but is associated with greater bone loss in cancellous bone; and ii) prevents load-induced bone formation in the cortex and inhibits the response in trabecular bone in male mice. It is difficult to conclude whether <italic>Lrp5</italic> status had similar effects in female mice since for most parameters, neither the female <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice nor their <italic>WT</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermate controls showed a significant dose:response to loading. In contrast, the presence of the <italic>Lrp5</italic> G171V HBM mutation in both males and females was associated with some protection against disuse-related bone loss in both cortical and cancellous bone and an increased osteogenic responsiveness to loading that was especially apparent in the females.</p><p>The rationale for examining the bone loss associated with disuse in these groups of mice was our hypothesis that if a more robust skeletal phenotype is a result of greater responsiveness to loading then the degree of bone loss associated with removal of the loading-related stimulus should also be greater. Conversely if a less robust skeletal phenotype were to be due to a lower osteogenic responsiveness to loading this should be reflected by a lower level of bone loss associated with disuse. In this experiment a direct comparison between all the genders and genotypes investigated was complicated by basal differences between the WT background of the <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>HBM+</italic></sup> and <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> colonies. This may have effects outside and in addition to anything related to loading. It is unknown whether osteoclast activity (which in these almost mature animals would have been responsible for the lower bone mass associated with disuse) is similar in timing or extent in the different groups, even though it has been shown that <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>HBM+</italic></sup> and <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice show no differences in their osteoclast number compared with WT controls <xref rid="bb0070 bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref>. With these reservations in mind, but assuming that such differences between groups are minor compared with the main effects of their <italic>Lrp5</italic> genotype, the outcome of the disuse experiment appears to be that in cortical bone the degree of bone loss is unaffected by the absence of functional <italic>Lrp5</italic>. In cancellous bone, absence of a functional <italic>Lrp5</italic> receptor is associated with greater disuse-related increase in trabecular spacing and decrease in BV/TV and trabecular number than in WT controls. In contrast the presence of the <italic>Lrp5</italic> G171V HBM mutation in the <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>HBM+</italic></sup> mice is associated with less loss of cortical and trabecular bone than in their <italic>WT</italic><sup><italic>HBM&#x02212;</italic></sup> controls. Similar findings on <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>HBM+</italic></sup> and <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice were reported by Bex et al. and Akhter et al. <xref rid="bb0135 bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[27,28]</xref>. This suggests that the more robust phenotype of these animals may not be solely due to any enhanced osteogenic response to loading but includes additional osteogenic responses to other stimuli with osteoregulatory effects.</p><p>The rationale for examining the osteogenic response to loading was to assess more directly the potential role of <italic>Lrp5</italic> in bone's responsiveness to mechanical loading. Since male <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice show no osteogenic response to loading in the bone cortex, and an absence of dose-responsiveness for trabecular thickness, compared with their dose-responsive WT controls, this could be ascribed to their <italic>Lrp5</italic> status. In contrast, female <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice showed a similar percent increase in cortical area and cancellous bone as their <italic>WT</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates in response to high strains (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Interpretation of how the absence of <italic>Lrp5</italic> influences the sensitivity across a range of strains is problematic in the female mice given that the female WT<sup>+/+</sup> mice of the <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> colony did not themselves show a dose:response relationship. The possibility that this lack of response was due to the magnitude of the peak strains not reaching an appropriate threshold is unlikely since at each strain there was a significant osteogenic response to loading that increased incrementally with strain. This was, however, not enough to show a significant a dose:response relationship. Similarly the possibility that there was some experimental error in the loading of this cohort of mice is unlikely since they were loaded and analysed as a mixed population interspersed within the other groups. Thus, while we cannot explain the apparently anomalous absence of a statistically significant dose:response relationship with increasing strain we have at present no grounds on which to discount it being a real phenomenon.</p><p>All mice from the <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>HBM+</italic></sup> colony showed a significant dose:response to loading in both cortical and cancellous bone parameters. The magnitude of this response was greater in mice expressing the <italic>Lrp5</italic> gain of function mutation. There also appeared to be an influence of gender on the sensitivity of these mice to loading. Female mice with the <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>HBM+</italic></sup> genotype show a significant osteogenic response at much lower magnitudes of strain than all other male and female genotypes. Although this is of interest, we have no evidence for the mechanism involved. Furthermore, the reason for the increased sensitivity to loading and reduced bone loss in response to disuse in <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>HBM+</italic></sup> mice is not clear. While it is tempting to ascribe this solely to the presence and activity of the <italic>Lrp5</italic> G171V HBM mutation, we do not know if increased sensitivity to loading is a function of the specific activity of the mutation or the result of having 4-fold higher <italic>Lrp5</italic> mRNA expression in bone compared with controls <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. There is support for it being the latter since Babij et al. <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> have shown that over expression of the wild type, non-mutated, <italic>Lrp5</italic> gene in bone of mice results in a modest increase in bone mass.</p><p>The results from our present study need to be compared with those of previous studies with similar objectives. Akhter et al. <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> report that in cortical bone female mice with the <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>HBM+</italic></sup> genotype showed greater increases in periosteal bone formation rates than WT controls in response to 5&#x000a0;days of tibial four-point bending.

These latter results are inconsistent with the data we generated for male mice, though the comparison to our female data is inconclusive. Our findings on male <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice are consistent with the findings of Sawakami et al. who report that after 3&#x000a0;days of sequential loading of the ulna, male and female <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice show an 88 to 99% lower response to loading in the cortical bone than WT controls <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Sawakami et al. also reported that male and female <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice are equally capable as <italic>WT</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice at recruiting osteoblasts in response to a single period of mechanical loading and that absence of functional <italic>Lrp5</italic> had little effect on early mediators of mechanical signalling, such as ATP and PGE2 release or ERK1/2 activation, that are detectable within seconds or minutes of mechanical stimulation. They attributed the deficiency of the fully osteogenic adaptive responses in their study to the inability of <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> osteoblasts to synthesise the bone matrix protein osteopontin. This would explain the significantly reduced osteogenic response in male <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice and supports the notion that the canonical Wnt signalling has a role in bone cells' response to mechanical loading. However, other data suggest that the mechanism might not be so clear cut as indicated by Kato's finding that Wnt-signalling still partially occurs in osteoblasts from <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, by Robling's finding that the sclerostin antibody can improve bone mass whether <italic>Lrp5</italic> is present or not <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, or by the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings by Sunters et al. <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and Case et al. <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> showing that during the early phase of the strain response, activation of the chief effector of the canonical Wnt pathway (&#x003b2;-catenin) is not contingent on Wnts interacting with the Lrp5 receptor. Thus, the required post-loading pathways in bone cells may also depend on other receptors, possibly Lrp4 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> or Lrp6 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The data we present here, at least in male mice, are consistent with the differences in bone mass between normal WT mice and those that lack <italic>Lrp5</italic> function, being due to an altered responsiveness to bone loading. Karsenty and colleagues attribute the low bone mass of the <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> related phenotype to the effect of <italic>Lrp5</italic> on serotonin secretion in the duodenum <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, this finding has not been replicated <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The <italic>Lrp5</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice in our study, as in that of Karsenty and colleagues, may have had high serotonin levels. However, Warden et al. <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> suggest that these high serotonin levels would not themselves affect the bones' adaptive responses to loading. Our data are therefore not inconsistent with Karsenty's conclusion but neither do they support it.</p><p>In conclusion, the data presented here indicate that the expression of the human <italic>Lrp5</italic> G171V HBM mutation is associated in both cortical and cancellous bone with an increased osteogenic responsiveness to supra-physiological loading, which is more marked in females than males, and with some protection against the bone loss associated with neurectomy-induced disuse.
