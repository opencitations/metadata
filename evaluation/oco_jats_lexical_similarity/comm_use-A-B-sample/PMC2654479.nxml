Darbepoetin alfa is an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) approved for treating chemotherapy-induced anaemia. This single-arm, phase 2 study examined the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa 500 &#x003bc;g every 3 weeks (Q3W) for treating anaemia in low-risk MDS patients (after 6 weeks, poor responders received darbepoetin alfa 500 &#x003bc;g every 2 weeks). The primary end-point was the incidence of erythroid responses (International Working Group criteria) after 13 weeks of therapy. Secondary end-points included the incidence of erythroid responses at weeks 28 and 55, [or weeks 27 and 53 for dose escalations to every two weeks (Q2W)], and safety parameters. Analyses were stratified by the patient's previous ESA therapy status [ESA-na&#x000ef;ve (<italic>n</italic> = 144) vs. prior ESA-treated (<italic>n</italic> = 62)]. After 13 weeks of therapy, 49% of ESA-na&#x000ef;ve patients and 26% of prior ESA-treated patients achieved a major erythroid response. After 53/55 weeks, 59% of ESA-na&#x000ef;ve patients and 34% of prior ESA-treated patients achieved a major erythroid response; 82% of ESA-na&#x000ef;ve patients and 55% of prior ESA-treated patients achieved target haemoglobin of 110 g/l. Thromboembolic or related adverse events occurred in 2% of patients; no pulmonary embolisms were reported. In conclusion, darbepoetin alfa, 500 &#x003bc;g Q3W appeared well tolerated and increased haemoglobin levels in low-risk MDS patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>myelodysplastic syndromes</kwd><kwd>erythropoiesis-stimulating agent</kwd><kwd>erythroid response</kwd><kwd>haemoglobin</kwd><kwd>transfusion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a haematologically and biologically diverse group of stem cell disorders characterized by accelerated apoptosis and ineffective haematopoiesis that lead to functional haematopoietic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Faderl &#x00026; Kantarjian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Catenacci &#x00026; Schiller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Hofmann &#x00026; Koeffler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Kurtin, 2006</xref>). Classification systems for distinguishing MDS subtypes associated with specific prognostic significance have been developed and include the French&#x02013;American&#x02013;British (FAB) system, the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bennett <italic>et al</italic>, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Greenberg <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Vardiman <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). These classification systems are used clinically in MDS patients to predict both survival and the risk of evolving to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).</p><p>Refractory anaemia (RA) resulting from ineffective erythropoiesis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with low-risk MDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bowen &#x00026; Hellstrom-Lindberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Hellstrom-Lindberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Hofmann &#x00026; Koeffler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Kurtin, 2006</xref>). Inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-alfa, transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-1 beta have been implicated in the accelerated apoptosis responsible for ineffective haematopoiesis and lineage-specific cytopenias (including anaemia) associated with MDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Raza <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Allampallam <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Faderl &#x00026; Kantarjian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Stifter <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Verma &#x00026; List, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Sekeres &#x00026; List, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Tehranchi, 2006</xref>). These inflammatory cytokines can also interfere with endogenous erythropoietin (eEPO) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Jelkmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>) which may contribute further to the anaemia observed in MDS patients. Though red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are often used to treat anaemia in patients with MDS disorders, transfusions can be complicated by infection, difficult cross match and subsequent iron overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Gupta <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gardin &#x00026; Fenaux, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Balducci, 2006</xref>). As an alternative to transfusions, studies have explored the efficacy of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) [alone and in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)] to correct MDS-induced anaemia by overcoming the inhibitory effects of pro-apoptotic cytokines, promoting survival of erythroid progenitors and enhancing erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hellstrom-Lindberg <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Hellstrom-Lindberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Musto <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Spiriti <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Stasi <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Balleari <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mannone <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). A review of published studies of low-risk MDS patients found a statistically significant benefit of growth factor therapy (including ESAs with or without colony stimulating factors) to both overall survival and progression-free survival compared with non-growth factor therapies (including differentiating agents, cytotoxic agents and immunomodulators). This improvement was observed at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of follow-up and was independent of FAB subtype, baseline transfusion need, IPSS score, previous treatment and time since diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Golshayan <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Some studies have also identified baseline classifications in low-risk MDS patients that predicted a favourable haematological response to ESA treatment. These prognostic factors included eEPO concentrations &#x02264;100 mU/ml, two or fewer RBC transfusions in the previous month and no excess blasts and/or hypoplastic bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Rose <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Hellstrom-Lindberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Musto <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In patients with low transfusion needs and low eEPO concentrations, a decision model predicted a good chance of favourable response to ESA treatment with or without G-CSF, and improved overall survival and quality-adjusted life years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Sekeres <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Darbepoetin alfa is a novel ESA that can be administered at extended dosing intervals, such as once every 3 weeks (Q3W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Kotasek <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Canon <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).

Prospectively defined secondary end-points evaluated the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa at 27/28 weeks and 53/55 weeks on the percentage of patients achieving an erythroid response, the change in haemoglobin concentration from baseline, the incidence of transfusions, the change in patient-reported fatigue, and incidence of adverse events.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The original protocol approved on 1 March 2004 specified a sample size of 120 patients who had not been previously treated with an ESA. A protocol amendment was approved on 18 May 2005 to allow patients who had previously received an ESA to be enroled (prior ESA therapy had to be stopped for 7 to 30 d before study enrolment). This amendment also increased the total sample size to 200 patients. This study was designed as an estimation study to determine major and minor response rates when darbepoetin alfa was administered to patients with low-risk MDS with and without prior ESA treatment to assist in planning future MDS studies.</p><p>Written approval was received from the Institutional Review Board at each study centre. Before study procedures (including screening) were initiated, informed consent was obtained from patients. All screening tests were performed within a maximum of 7 d before enrolment, with eligible patients being enroled within 7 d after completion of screening. An interactive voice-response system was called to obtain a unique identification number for each patient. Patients who terminated prematurely from the study were not replaced.</p><p>Patients &#x02265;18 years were eligible for this study if they had a haemoglobin concentration &#x02264;110 g/l, adequate iron stores, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status score of 0 to 2, adequate renal and liver function and low-risk MDS (low- or intermediate-1-risk as defined by the IPSS) with a FAB classification of RA, RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) or RA with excess blasts (RAEB) (with blasts &#x02264;10%). FAB and IPSS classifications were determined by complete blood cell counts and bone marrow biopsies obtained within 8 weeks before enrolment for ESA-na&#x000ef;ve patients or 8 weeks before initiation of ESA therapy for currently treated patients.</p><p>Patients were excluded from this study if they had a previous bone marrow or stem cell transplant, history of transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, history of pure red cell aplasia, class II or IV cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant systemic infection or chronic inflammatory disease, anaemia related to nutritional deficiencies or other causes (including haemolysis, bleeding, sickle-cell anaemia and renal disease), history of malignancies other than MDS and previous or ongoing treatment with biological response modifiers except for ESAs (which had to be discontinued at least 7 d and not more than 30 d before enrolment) or G-CSF, which could be used for neutropenic fever or infection during the 30 d before study enrolment. Patients were also excluded if they received investigational agents not approved for any indication during the 30 d before enrolment, received ongoing corticosteroid therapy (other than as premedication for transfusions), received methotrexate or MDS-targeted therapy (including chemotherapy, antibody-based cancer treatments, hormonal therapies, interferons and interleukins) within 30 d before screening, received radiotherapy in the year before screening or planned to receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 28 weeks after enrolment. Additional reasons for patient exclusion included a positive human immunodeficiency virus test, positive antibody response to an ESA, known failure of ESAs to treat anaemia and known hypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa or any of its excipients. Patients were also excluded if they were pregnant, breast-feeding or not using adequate contraception.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase 2, stratified, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study of darbepoetin alfa for treating anaemic patients with MDS.</p><p>Study day 1 (no more than 4 d after enrolment) was the day on which the first dose of darbepoetin alfa was administered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig&#x000a0;1</xref>). This study was prospectively divided into specific time-points during treatment, which were related to the primary and secondary end-points of the study.

All doses of darbepoetin alfa were administered subcutaneously. Darbepoetin alfa was escalated to 500 &#x003bc;g Q2W after 6 weeks (at week 7) of treatment for patients who did not achieve either &#x02265;10 g/l haemoglobin increase over baseline levels or maintain haemoglobin levels in the range of 110&#x02013;120 g/l. Subsequent doses were administered at the frequency received as of week 7, regardless of subsequent dose reductions. If haemoglobin concentrations increased to between 120 and 130 g/l, darbepoetin alfa was reduced to a dose of 300 &#x003bc;g at the same frequency as previously administered. For patients receiving 500 &#x003bc;g darbepoetin alfa and who had an increase &#x0003e;10 g/l in haemoglobin concentration in any 2-week period, the dose of study drug was reduced to 300 &#x003bc;g using the most recent dosing frequency. For patients who exceeded the haemoglobin threshold of &#x02265;130 g/l, darbepoetin alfa was withheld until haemoglobin levels decreased to &#x02264;120 g/l, wherein it was re-instated at 300 &#x003bc;g.

Throughout the study, patients could be treated with any concomitant medications or treatments necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those treatments listed in the exclusion criteria (see &#x02018;Study population&#x02019;). Iron supplementation was administered (to support erythropoiesis) according to the policy of each institution.</p></sec><sec><title>Study end-points and assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy end-point was the percentage of patients who achieved either a major or minor erythroid response during the initial 13 weeks (test period) of darbepoetin alfa therapy. A major erythroid response was defined as either a &#x02265;20 g/l increase in haemoglobin concentration from baseline (in the absence of a RBC transfusion within the preceding 28 d) or transfusion independence for patients who were transfusion-dependent at screening (transfusion dependence was defined as at least three RBC transfusions in the 3 months before screening). A minor erythroid response was defined as either an increase in haemoglobin concentration of &#x02265;10 to &#x0003c;20 g/l from baseline (in the absence of a RBC transfusion within the preceding 28 d) or a 50% decrease in transfusion requirements for patients who were transfusion-dependent at screening. An alternative definition of erythroid response based on the updated IWG definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Cheson <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) was used as a sensitivity analysis for responses during the extended treatment period by baseline eEPO categories. This was defined as an initial increase in haemoglobin of &#x02265;15 g/l from baseline (in the absence of an RBC transfusion within the preceding 28 d) and an average increase in haemoglobin of &#x02265;15 g/l from baseline that was sustained for 8 weeks following the initial rise. This definition made no distinction between major and minor responses.</p><p>Prospectively defined secondary end-points analysed during the extended treatment period of darbepoetin alfa therapy included the percentage of patients who achieved a major or minor erythroid response, incidence of haemoglobin response (haemoglobin concentration increase of &#x02265;20 g/l from baseline in the absence of RBC transfusions within the preceding 28 d), the mean change in haemoglobin levels from baseline to week 53/55, the incidence of RBC transfusions and the mean change in the patient-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F) score from baseline to week 53/55. Additional end-points analysed during the extended treatment period included the incidence of achieving the targeted haemoglobin range of 110 to 130 g/l, the mean haemoglobin concentration maintained after achieving the haemoglobin target and the percentage of patients who maintained haemoglobin concentrations within the target range of 110&#x02013;130 g/l. This haemoglobin target range was based on evidence-based guidelines to minimize transfusion requirements and to maximize quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients with anaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rizzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bokemeyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Rodgers <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Additional QOL measures included the EQ-5D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brooks <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and three additional patient-related outcome questions concerning energy, activity and overall health. Safety end-points included incidence of adverse events, the percentage of patients who exceeded the haemoglobin threshold of &#x02265;130 g/l, and the percentage of patients who withdrew from the study because of disease progression.</p><p>Complete blood count tests were performed weekly by a central laboratory from weeks 1 to 13 and then Q3W from weeks 13 to 28 (or Q2W from weeks 13 to 27 if the dose frequency was escalated at week 7). Haemoglobin concentrations were also measured at each dosing visit by a local laboratory to determine if any dose adjustments were necessary. A central laboratory was used to determine the presence of antibodies to darbepoetin alfa at baseline, at week 27/28 and at the end of study.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This final analysis included all data up to week 53/55. Analyses were stratified by the patient's previous ESA therapy status (ESA-na&#x000ef;ve vs. prior ESA-treated), as specified in the study protocol. <sc>sas</sc> (version 9, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all data analyses. Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages and continuous variables were summarized using means, standard deviations and 95% confidence limits (CLs).</p><p>The primary and the safety analysis set consisted of all enroled patients who received at least one dose of darbepoetin alfa.

In the available data approach, missing haemoglobin values were not imputed. In the summaries of PRO end-points, the available data approach was used, and the data were not adjusted for RBC transfusions.</p><p>The crude proportions of patients who had a major erythroid response or a minor erythroid response were summarized, and 95% CLs were constructed for the percentages of patients in each category by using the normal approximations.

Previous studies have shown that recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) can induce a response (raise haemoglobin levels and reduce transfusion requirements) in about 30% of low-risk MDS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Rose <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hellstrom-Lindberg <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Hellstrom-Lindberg, 2005</xref>). When administered with G-CSF, the percentage of low-risk MDS patients who respond to rHuEPO therapy may increase to about 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Casadevall <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Catenacci &#x00026; Schiller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Balleari <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), particularly in the RARS subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hellstrom-Lindberg <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2003</xref>). Several evidence-based guidelines have supported the use of ESAs for treating anaemia in MDS patients, albeit at higher doses than those used for patients with CIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alessandrino <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Greenberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>This study suggests that darbepoetin alfa may also be an effective therapy for treating anaemia associated with MDS. Results indicated that darbepoetin alfa 500 &#x003bc;g Q3W was well tolerated and capable of meaningfully increasing haemoglobin levels over a 53/55-week period in low-risk MDS patients. The study patients were able to achieve a major erythroid response, a target haemoglobin of 110 g/l and maintain haemoglobin in the range of 110 to 130 g/l (consistent with the range recommended by evidence-based guidelines at the time for ESA therapy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rizzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bokemeyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Rodgers <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In addition, treatment with darbepoetin alfa appeared to reduce fatigue. Transfusion requirements were 28% in ESA-na&#x000ef;ve and 42% in prior ESA-treated populations over the 53/55-week treatment period. An effect of darbepoetin alfa therapy on transfusion incidence over time may have been difficult to detect because overall transfusion requirements in this study were relatively low, reflecting the fact that most patients in this study were not transfusion-dependent at screening. As the study did not include an untreated control group, further assessment of efficacy was not possible.</p><p>It is important to identify patients for whom ESA treatment may have a lower probability of success. Although not an end-point of this study, based on previously suggested predictors of haematological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Rose <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Hellstrom-Lindberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Musto <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), we examined factors associated with erythroid responses. In this study, most patients who achieved an erythroid response (major or minor) during the study did so during the 13-week test period. The low percentage of patients who had a first erythroid response during weeks 13 to 27/28 of the treatment period and the lack of any initial erythroid responses from week 27/28 to the end of study suggest that patients without a change in haemoglobin by 13 weeks of treatment independent of transfusion may not benefit from continued therapy. In patients with eEPO levels &#x0003c;100 mU/ml, a trend towards more favourable response was observed in accordance with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Rose <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Hellstrom-Lindberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Musto <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Patients with a low risk score in the IPSS classification system also appeared to respond to ESA treatment more frequently than did those with an Intermediate-1 score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig&#x000a0;5</xref>). Baseline transfusion requirement is another recognized predictor of response to therapy. However, because of the low number of patients receiving frequent transfusions at study entry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table&#x000a0;I</xref>), this could not be used as a predictive factor in this study. It is interesting to note that patients who were ESA-na&#x000ef;ve responded more robustly to treatment with darbepoetin alfa than patients who had been previously treated with an ESA. The reasons for the response difference by prior treatment status are unclear. As the majority of previously ESA-treated patients had been on treatment for over a year, there were probably differences in duration of disease between the groups. A further contributing factor may have been the lower baseline eEPO values in the ESA-na&#x000ef;ve group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table&#x000a0;III</xref>).</p><p>The safety profile reported in this study was similar to that reported in other darbepoetin alfa studies in the setting of CIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Vansteenkiste <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Hedenus <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). During the 53/55-week treatment period, thromboembolic events only occurred in 2% of MDS patients, all of which resolved. This rate is somewhat lower than that observed in patients with CIA treated with ESAs. Overall, hypertension was experienced by 5% of patients, but occurred in 10% of patients who exceeded the threshold haemoglobin level of 130 g/l compared with 3% of those who remained below the haemoglobin threshold. This was the only adverse event that appeared potentially related to exceeding the haemoglobin threshold of 130 g/l in this study. This withholding level was consistent with the product information (Amgen Inc.) for darbepoetin alfa in CIA when this study was designed, although the current product information states that darbepoetin alfa be temporarily withheld if haemoglobin levels exceed 120 g/l in patients with CIA. We observed a low rate of disease progression to AML or other leukaemias, in accordance with other studies evaluating the use of darbepoetin alfa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Stasi <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mannone <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) or erythropoietin alfa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hellstrom-Lindberg <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) in low-risk MDS patients. Two retrospective cohort studies have also shown no negative impact of ESAs on AML progression or overall survival in MDS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Jadersten <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2006</xref>).</p><p>Other studies have also examined the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa for treating anaemia in MDS patients. One pilot study and one phase 2 study have shown that darbepoetin alfa administered 150 &#x003bc;g/week to low- or intermediate-risk MDS patients can induce a major erythroid response in 35&#x02013;40% of patients without apparent safety concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Musto <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Stasi <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In a phase 2 study that examined darbepoetin alfa administered 300 &#x003bc;g/week with or without G-CSF, 55% of low-risk MDS patients treated with darbepoetin alfa alone achieved a major erythroid response; additional responses were obtained in patients who had been unresponsive to darbepoetin alfa as a single agent when G-CSF was administered concomitantly with darbepoetin alfa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mannone <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Results from a recent retrospective cohort study suggested that darbepoetin alfa and Epoetin alfa were equally effective in treating MDS-induced anaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Patton <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the findings presented here suggest that treating low-risk MDS patients with darbepoetin alfa provides a clinical benefit for an otherwise debilitating chronic anaemia. This study of low-risk MDS patients treated with darbepoetin alfa for 53/55 weeks resulted in excellent response rates with infrequent drug dosing. The ability to administer darbepoetin alfa therapy at extended dosing intervals, such as Q2W or Q3W, may contribute to increased patient convenience by reducing the number of clinic visits for anaemia treatment. This feature of darbepoetin alfa may be especially advantageous for patients who require ESA therapy for treating anaemia over a long period of time. Future studies are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alfa in MDS patients (both low-risk and high-risk) to identify predictors of response to darbepoetin alfa therapy and to also evaluate the impact of darbepoetin alfa therapy on QOL in this patient population.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Conflict of interest disclosure</title><p>Several authors (D.T. and L.D.) are employed by Amgen Inc. and own Amgen Inc. stock.
