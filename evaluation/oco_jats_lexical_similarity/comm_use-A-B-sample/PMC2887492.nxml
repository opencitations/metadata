Total RNA was extracted from loaded and contra-lateral non-loaded tibiae at selected time points after a single, short period of dynamic loading sufficient to engender an osteogenic response. There were marked changes in the expression of many genes according to context as well as in response to loading within those contexts. In WT mice at 3, 8, 12 and 24&#x000a0;h after loading the expression of 642, 341, 171 and 24 genes, respectively, were differentially regulated compared with contra-lateral bones which were not loaded. Only a few of the genes differentially regulated by loading in the tibiae of WT mice have recognized roles in bone metabolism or have been linked previously to osteogenesis (<italic>Opn</italic>, <italic>Sost</italic>, <italic>Esr1</italic>, <italic>Tgfb1</italic>, <italic>Lrp1</italic>, <italic>Ostn</italic>, <italic>Timp</italic>, <italic>Mmp</italic>, <italic>Ctgf</italic>, <italic>Postn</italic> and <italic>Irs1</italic>, <italic>BMP</italic> and <italic>DLX5</italic>). The canonical pathways showing the greatest loading-related regulation were those involving pyruvate metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium-induced apoptosis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, aryl hydrocarbon receptor and oxidative phosphorylation. In the tibiae from WT-OVX, ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT-SN mice, 440, 439 and 987 genes respectively were differentially regulated by context alone compared to WT. The early response to loading in tibiae of WT-OVX mice involved differential regulation compared to their contra-lateral non-loaded pair of fewer genes than in WT, more down-regulation than up-regulation and a later response. This was shared by WT-SN. In tibiae of ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the number of genes differentially regulated by loading was markedly reduced at all time points.</p><p>These data indicate that in resident bone cells, both basal and loading-related gene expression is substantially modified by context.

Paradoxically the clinical significance of the relationship in humans increases as, in affluent Western societies at least, habitual exposure of the skeleton to substantial load bearing declines. One correlate of this decline, which may indeed be partially a consequence, is the increasing incidence of fractures resulting from skeletal fragility <xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>.</p><p>Skeletal architecture is the product over time of coordinated activity of populations of cells which form and resorb bone (osteoblasts and osteoclasts respectively). The osteoblast population (and their derivates the osteocytes) reside in close proximity to the matrix which is responsible for carrying functional loads. The stimulus used by this population of cells to control structurally appropriate modeling and remodeling of their matrix is assumed to be derived from the strains that functional load-bearing engenders <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[5,6]</xref>. Despite the importance of this relationship the mechanisms by which resident bone cells transduce mechanical information into biochemical responses and then process it into signals controlling the modeling and remodeling behaviour of osteocytes, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, is obscure.</p><p>Mechanical loading is not the only stimulus to which bone cells respond since they are exposed to all the other nutritional, endocrine, paracrine and autocrine stimuli inherent to their situation <italic>in vivo</italic>. They are particularly responsive to estrogen, to an extent that seems unnecessary for the discharge of this hormone's primarily reproductive responsibilities. Associated with this responsiveness, there is a rapid loss of bone in women at the time of estrogen withdrawal at the menopause. The level of bone loss in women at the menopause and the subsequent slower, progressive age-related loss that occurs in both men and women are substantially related to their levels of bio-available estrogen <xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[7&#x02013;10]</xref>. Despite recognition of this association, the mechanisms by which reduction in circulating estrogen levels account for this bone loss have never been satisfactorily explained. In contrast the estrogen receptor (ER), specifically ER&#x003b1;, has been shown to be involved in bone cells' early responses to strain both <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="bib11 bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[11&#x02013;13]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In humans, genetic variation in ER&#x003b1; is associated with different responses to load-bearing exercise <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. ER&#x003b1; is also one of the genes in which variation is associated with the severity of osteoporosis <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In mice when ER&#x003b1; is absent the adaptive response to artificial loading <italic>in vivo</italic> is attenuated <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The levels of ER&#x003b1; in osteoblasts and osteocytes are regulated by estrogen but not by strain <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> so the down-regulation of ER&#x003b1; associated with low levels of estrogen may reduce the effectiveness of bone cells' ER&#x003b1;-mediated responses to strain <xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>. This would allow reduction of bone mass with its associated increases in fragility, functional strains and fracture incidence.</p><p>Although these studies provide a possible explanation for how the reduced effectiveness of bone cells' osteogenic response to bone loading could be associated with estrogen-related decline in ER&#x003b1;, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Microarray technology provides a means to examine simultaneously the gene expression of the entire transcriptome in a single sample of bone. In this article, we describe experiments designed to establish the pattern of gene expression in resident cells of the tibia of normal female wild-type (WT) mice following a single period of <italic>in vivo</italic> loading with demonstrated capacity to stimulate osteogenesis. The pattern of gene expression following such a single period of &#x0201c;osteogenic&#x0201d; loading should be the gene regulation &#x0201c;signature&#x0201d; of the stimulus for the osteogenic response. To establish that &#x0201c;signature&#x0201d;, we compared the pattern of gene expression in bones that had recently experienced a single, short period of artificial loading with that from their contra-lateral controls that were only exposed to habitual, natural loading.</p><p>We then established the differences from this &#x0201c;signature&#x0201d; arising from three relevant contexts: estrogen deficiency, lack of ER&#x003b1; and disuse. Estrogen deficiency and disuse were achieved in WT C57BL/6 mice by ovariectomy (WT-OVX) and unilateral sciatic neurectomy (WT-SN), respectively. Absence of ER&#x003b1; was achieved by using an ER&#x003b1; knockout mouse on a C57BL/6 genetic background <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Female C57BL/6 (WT) mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Margate, Kent, UK). Ovariectomy and sciatic neurectomy were performed on WT mice at 11&#x000a0;weeks of age. ER&#x003b1; null mutant mice (ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> were a gift from Ken Korach. The model was created by targeting ER&#x003b1; gene in ET12TG2a ES cells and injecting the targeted cells into C57BL/6 blastocytes. Resultant chimeras were backcrossed to C57BL/6 for 10 generations. The poor breeding performance of the ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice meant that we were unable to use extensive backcrossing to ensure that the two breeding populations were maintained as genetically similar as possible. Thus, it must be remembered that differences in gene regulation between these two populations could be contributed to by genetic drift as well as the presence or absence of ER&#x003b1;. All experiments were approved by the Royal Veterinary College's ethics committee and by the UK Home Office.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanical loading of the mouse tibia <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To firstly establish the osteogenic response of a single loading session, the right tibiae of six female WT mice were exposed to a single period of loading in sine wave form producing a peak strain of &#x02212;&#x000a0;1300 microstrain at a frequency of 2&#x000a0;Hz for 30&#x000a0;s (60 cycles). The contra-lateral limb was not loaded and served as an internal control. The apparatus and protocol for dynamically loading the mouse tibia were essentially the same as reported previously <xref rid="bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr">[22, 23]</xref>.</p><p>Bone formation was assessed from the distribution of two calcein labels (7&#x000a0;mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., Gillingham, UK) injected intraperitoneally on the day of loading and 48&#x000a0;h later. Mice were euthanized on the 4th day after loading. The tibiae from these animals were processed as described earlier <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The calcein labels were read using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, GmbH, Gena, Germany).</p><p>In the non-loaded control tibiae of the six WT mice, the cross-sectional area of bone deposited in the 48&#x000a0;h between the two labels at 37% along the bone shafts from the proximal end of the tibia was 588&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;124&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>. In the contra-lateral tibiae of these mice, which were exposed to a single period of dynamic axial loading, the area of new bone at the same site was 873&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;127&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>; a statistically significant increase of 48 percent (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).</p><p>For the microarray experiment, the right tibiae of 15-week-old female WT (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;32), ovariectomized (WT-OVX, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x000a0;32), neurectomized (WT-SN, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x000a0;40) and ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x000a0;24) were subjected to a single period of dynamic axial load using a hydraulic actuator under feedback control (Dartec HC10, Zwick Testing Machines Ltd., Leominster, UK). The load was applied during this single period of loading in a sine waveform, at a frequency of 2&#x000a0;Hz for 30&#x000a0;s (60 cycles). The peak load magnitude for each group was adjusted to produce a peak compressive strain of &#x02212;&#x000a0;1300 microstrain measured by longitudinally aligned strain gauges attached to the medial mid-shaft of separate &#x0201c;calibration&#x0201d; mice. For WT and ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the peak load necessary to achieve a peak strain of &#x02212;&#x000a0;1300 microstrain was 12&#x000a0;N and for the WT-OVX and WT-SN mice 8&#x000a0;N.</p><p>In the WT-SN group, a separate group of mice were sciatic neurectomized and the tibiae in their neurectomized hindlimbs used as non-loaded controls. In the other groups (WT, WT-OVX and ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), the contra-lateral limb was not loaded and this served as an internal control. In every case, mice whose tibiae were to be loaded were anesthetized with halothane for approximately 3&#x000a0;min during which loading took place. They were allowed to recover immediately after loading. Eight animals were sacrificed at each time point of 3, 8, 12 and 24&#x000a0;h after loading except for mice in the ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> group where shortage of animals meant that sampling at only 3, 8 and 24&#x000a0;h was possible.</p><p>A recent report by Sample et al. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> suggests that vigorous loading of the rat ulna on one side produces regional and systemic changes in remodeling of adjacent bones and those in the contra-lateral limb. To confirm that this was not the case in our experiments, we have compared the remodeling in left and right non-loaded bones of mice to that in bones contra-lateral to those which have been loaded. We detect no difference in the remodeling in these contra-lateral bones from that in either left or right bones in individuals that have experienced no loading <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. From this we are confident that in our experiments the (re)modeling response to loading and the changes in gene expression that precede and control it are confined to the bone actually loaded. Thus, the use of the non-loaded contra-lateral bone as a control is valid.</p></sec><sec><title>Total RNA isolation from mouse bones</title><p>The right and left tibiae were carefully dissected and all their surrounding musculature removed leaving the periosteum intact. The cartilaginous ends of the bones were removed and the remaining tibial shaft spun at 5000&#x000a0;rpm for 2&#x000a0;min (Eppendorf centrifuge) to remove the marrow. The tibial shafts were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and lysed in Qiazol lysis reagent (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, UK). Total RNA from these lysed samples was purified and DNase treated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quantity and the integrity of the purified RNA was assessed using the Agilent RNA Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies UK Limited, Stockport, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA preparation</title><p>Double-stranded cDNA was synthesised from the tibial shaft-derived total RNA (1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) using a SMART protocol (Clontech-Takara Bio Europe, 78100 Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Two microliters of this first strand reaction was used in the amplification step which was performed using 17 rounds of cycling. The double-stranded cDNA was checked on a 1.2% agarose gel before the samples were purified using QIAquick clean up columns (Qiagen). The amount of cDNA amplified was then checked using the NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Labtech International, Ringmer, East Sussex, UK). For the reference cDNA, a pool containing 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of each of the individual RNA samples was used. This RNA pool was then used to prepare cDNA using the SMART protocol (as above). The cDNA from the second strand reactions were then pooled, thus ensuring that the same reference cDNA was used in every hybridization. A common reference design scheme enabled any sample to be compared with any of the other samples.</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA labelling and microarray hybridization and scanning</title><p>Using the Bioprime labelling kits (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK), 750&#x000a0;ng of purified cDNA was labelled by incorporating 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of Cye dye (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK). After incubating for 3&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the labels were purified using ProbeQuant G50 micro columns (GE Healthcare). Incorporation rates were determined using a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrometer before specific labels were pooled and dried down to completion. The labels were re-suspended in 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of hybridization buffer (40% deionised formamide; 5&#x000d7; Denhart's; 5&#x000d7; SSC; 1&#x000a0;mM Na pyrophosphate; 50&#x000a0;mM Tris pH 7.4; 0.1% SDS) and hybridized onto an RNG-MRC mouse set 25K microarray printed on GE Codelink slide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.har.mrc.ac.uk/services/MPC/microarray/">http://www.har.mrc.ac.uk/services/MPC/microarray/</ext-link>), overnight at 48&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in a water bath using the Corning hybridization chambers. Three replicate hybridizations were performed for each sample. After hybridization, the arrays were washed initially in 2&#x000d7; SSC until the coverslip had come off, then for 5&#x000a0;min with vigorous shaking in 0.1&#x000d7; SSC, 0.1% SDS and finally in 0.1&#x000d7; SSC for 2&#x000a0;min with further vigorous shaking. The arrays were then spun dry and scanned using a ProScanArray HT (PerkinElmer, Maidenhead, UK) at 7 different photomultiplicator (PMT) gain settings from 40 to 70. The images were then processed using ImaGene 6.0.1 (Bio Discovery, El Segundo, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of microarray</title><p>Global gene expression was examined in 27 different RNA pools from loaded and corresponding non-loaded mouse tibiae as well as a reference pool (containing 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of each of the individual 27 RNA samples) using an oligonucleotide array consisting of 25,000 target genes. The scanned images were processed using ImaGene 6.0.1 (BioDiscovery, PerkinElmer), where all images from a single array were overlaid and gridded and the feature data extracted. These data were then further processed using Mavi 2.6.0 (MWG Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany), which increases the dynamic range while avoiding saturation problems. The software performs a linear regression analysis on each gene across the increasing PMT gains to detect any saturation or degradation of signal and returns the value at a set PMT for all genes, giving a single data set from the 7 multi-gain sets for each array. The data were then loaded into R Project for Statistical Computing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>) for further analysis. A two-dimensional loess normalization, from the YASMA5 (Yet Another Statistical Microarray Analysis) library, was performed on each array to correct for any spatial variation within the slide. The LIMMA <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> library (Linear Model for Microarray Analysis) from the BioConductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org">http://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>) software project was used further to normalize the data and to select differentially expressed genes. In brief, a linear model is fitted to the data for each gene to fully model the systematic part of the data and provide estimates for each coefficient (samples in this case). These coefficients can then be compared and differentially expressed genes selected using an empirical Bayes moderated <italic>t</italic>-statistic. Data were loaded into LIMMA and control spots were zero-weighted, so the slides were normalized within slide using loess and then normalized across the slide using a quantile normalization only on the reference sample for each array <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Each array was then given a weight based on how well it fits the linear model. This was then used during the model fitting stage <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. A contrast matrix comparing every sample to every other sample was fitted to allow all possible comparisons to be made. Differential genes were selected for the comparisons of interest based on their moderated <italic>t</italic>-statistic <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> after using a false discovery rate control of 5% <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Fitted values for each sample were then loaded into GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies, Stockport, UK) to allow for easy comparison of lists of differential genes. These lists were further filtered using a Grubbs Test to remove genes with high variance in the control replicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed genes</title><p>We used Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) to arrange the gene expression data according to complexes, canonical signaling pathways and networks. To do this, we uploaded the data of genes differentially expressed by context into IPA and mapped these data to their corresponding genes in the Ingenuity knowledge base. The canonical pathway analysis identified the pathways from the IPA library that were most significant to each data set. The <italic>p</italic>-value, evaluated using the right-tailed Fisher's exact test, of each pathway was calculated by comparing the number of user specified genes of interest (i.e., differentially regulated genes) that participated in a given pathway relative to the total number of occurrences of these genes in all pathway annotations stored in the Ingenuity knowledge base. The functional analysis identified functions that were most significant to the data set. Heat map visualization of clusters formed was generated by using CLADIST (Integrated Cluster and Interaction and Transcriptional Networks Analysis Tool) developed by LICR-Bioinformatics Group. CLADIST is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pstiing.licr.org/"><italic>http://pstiing.licr.org/</italic></ext-link>).

The level of significance of differential regulation of each of these pathways was reduced at the later sampling points. Using this set of canonical pathways as a template, genes differentially regulated by loading at all sampling time points in tibiae from WT, WT-OVX, ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT-SN mice were processed using IPA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>Differential regulation of the pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling and calcium-induced T cell apoptosis reached significance only in WT loaded mice.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is significantly regulated in response to loading in both WT and ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> tibiae but the commonality ends there. In tibiae from WT mice the genes associated with this pathway, coding for products which catalyse the transfer of electrons in the inner mitochondrial membrane, are all up-regulated (NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex 4 (<italic>Ndufa4</italic>, 1.9-fold), <italic>Ndufa9</italic> (1.9-fold), <italic>Ndufb9</italic> (1.7-fold), cytochrome C oxidase subunit VIIa polypeptide 1 (<italic>Cox7a1</italic>, 2.7-fold), <italic>Cox7b</italic> (1.5-fold), <italic>Cox8b</italic> (1.8-fold) and ATP synthase subunit alpha (<italic>Atp5a1</italic>, 1.6-fold)).

In the experiments reported here, a single 30-s period of dynamic loading engendering strains of physiological magnitude was sufficient to initiate a cascade of events culminating days later in measurable increase in bone formation. One experimental advantage of this phenomenon is that it is possible to follow the time course of events involved in the post-loading cascade following a single stimulatory event. The shortness of the stimulatory &#x0201c;pulse&#x0201d; is significant in this context since it avoids the problem of trying to identify a single sequence of post-loading events in a system which has been exposed to and is responding to, either a single prolonged period of stimulation or a series of separate periods of stimulation.</p><p>Previously documented efforts to determine the earliest cell changes involved in the transduction of strain-related events into cellular responses have identified almost immediate fluxes in calcium both within the cell and between the cell and its extra-cellular environment <xref rid="bib42 bib43" ref-type="bibr">[42,43]</xref>; rearrangements in the cells' cytoskeleton and their attachments to the surrounding matrix <xref rid="bib44 bib45" ref-type="bibr">[44,45]</xref>; the production of prostanoids and nitric oxide (NO) <xref rid="bib46 bib47 bib48 bib49" ref-type="bibr">[46-49]</xref>; and activation of ERK signaling <xref rid="bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[11,12]</xref>. These changes occur within minutes of exposure to the strain-related stimulus. Our study aimed to establish the pattern of gene expression using microarray analysis in the 24&#x000a0;h following a single loading-related osteogenic stimulus in four different contexts each with established relevance to the loading-related response. The contexts were normality (WT), estrogen deficiency (WT-OVX), disuse (WT-SN) and the absence of ER&#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>). Each of the different contexts was associated with a distinct pattern of gene expression in which hundreds of genes were differentially expressed. The effects of loading in these different contexts were similarly associated with differential expression in hundreds of genes.</p><p>In none of the contexts we examined was there marked differential regulation of the genes directly associated with the immediate signaling events just referred to (prostaglandins, NO and ERK) except those related to integrin signaling and caveolin. These immediate signaling events primarily involve changes in the activity of factors already present rather than their production through transcriptional regulation of the relevant genes. Regulation of production presumably occurs over a longer time period and in most cases follows, rather than is required for, changes in the activity of cell signaling pathways. In these experiments, our earliest time point after loading (3&#x000a0;h) was chosen to catch the earliest changes we expected in gene regulation. The large differences in gene expression that we observed at this time point suggest that this regulatory response was well under way by this time and that an earlier time point would have been desirable.</p><p>Estrogen deficiency is known to cause significant bone loss in mice as well as in humans <xref rid="bib50 bib51" ref-type="bibr">[50,51]</xref>. In our present study, lack of estrogen associated with ovariectomy (WT-OVX) was associated with an increase in expression levels of mRNA for ER&#x003b1;, an estrogen receptor subtype that plays an important role in bone biology. This is in agreement with previous findings where a reduction in estrogen levels brought on by OVX in rats <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and menopause in women <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> resulted in marked increases in ER&#x003b1; mRNA levels.

The most significant of these was the integrin signaling pathway. Importantly the expression of alpha integrins associated with this pathway was down-regulated by OVX thereby possibly compromising integrin mediated signaling. Genes that mapped to the mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were all also down-regulated in WT-OVX. This is particularly interesting in relation to the recently reported relationship between bone and energy metabolism <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p>We previously reported not only that the osteogenic response to loading was smaller in Korach-derived ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice than WT <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> but that the osteoblast-like cells derived from these mice had a higher basal level of NO which was not elevated further by mechanical strain <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. At the time that we made this observation we could offer no explanation for it. Data from the current study suggest a possible mechanism. The Korach-derived ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice express a short (46&#x000a0;kDa) form of ER produced by alternative splicing <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> which, it has been suggested, may trigger rapid, non-genomic signal responses <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Our microarray data analysis shows that the basal expression of <italic>Strn</italic>, the gene for striatin is up-regulated by 10.7-fold in ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Striatin acts as a molecular anchor that localizes ER&#x003b1; to the membrane caveolae and organizes an ER&#x003b1;-eNOS membrane signaling complex for a rapid, non-genomic activation of eNOS <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.

Consistent with this finding, there was a small loading-related increase in the expression of <italic>Esr1</italic> mRNA expression in tibiae from WT mice.</p><p>A possible relationship between the level of expression of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and the bone mass observed in WT-OVX and ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice does not hold true in the case of WT-SN mice. Here, neurectomy-induced bone loss occurs on a background of increased expression of genes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Other studies have also implicated canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the regulation of bone mass <xref rid="bib59 bib60" ref-type="bibr">[59,60]</xref>. Eight genes associated with Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling were up-regulated in WT-SN mice, four of which code for known inhibitors of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway (<italic>Sfrp1</italic>, <italic>Sfrp4</italic>, <italic>Sfrp4</italic> and <italic>Dkk3</italic>). Reduced signaling through the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway could be responsible for the reduced bone mass in WT-SN mice <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Possibly as a compensatory mechanism in tibiae from WT-SN mice, the expression of a number of growth factor genes was up-regulated. A large number of genes involved in adhesion were also up-regulated in tibiae from WT-SN mice. Although sciatic neurectomy is a widely used model of disuse <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, it is known to induce some degree of physiological stress, although probably less than tail suspension, as well as reduced innervation of the neurectomized limb <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. It is possible therefore that the neurectomy-induced changes in bone modeling/remodeling may not be due to unloading alone.</p><p>Comparison of the gene expression profile of the loaded and non-loaded tibiae in WT mice revealed differential up-regulation of a number of bone-specific genes. One of the genes markedly up-regulated at 3&#x000a0;h after loading was osteopontin.

In contrast to WT mice, osteopontin expression levels were only down-regulated by loading in tibiae from WT-OVX mice and remained unchanged in tibiae from WT-SN and ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at all time points after loading.</p><p>Periostin is an osteoblast-specific factor which has a role in cell adhesion.

Periostin knockout mice have low levels of trabecular bone <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Osteocrin expression was also similarly up-regulated by loading.

This early up-regulation was reversed only in WT mice leading to a 2-fold down-regulation whereas in ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>its levels remained above that of the non-loaded controls. In contrast to WT and ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, <italic>Sost</italic> expression was down-regulated in WT-OVX mice earlier after loading (3&#x000a0;h). In common with WT, in WT-OVX <italic>Sost</italic> expression was also down-regulated at 12&#x000a0;h after loading.

The Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway is known to be important in regulating bone mass <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. It has recently been proposed that sclerostin, a protein which is almost osteocyte specific, plays an essential role in mediating bone's response to loading through antagonizing Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Thus, lower levels of <italic>Sost</italic>/sclerostin expression would lead to enhanced Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling resulting in a load-related osteogenic response. The lack of down-regulation of <italic>Sost</italic> expression in tibiae from ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice indicates disruption in this potentially critical strain-related pathway.</p><p>In addition to the &#x0201c;usual suspects&#x0201d;, the microarray analysis identified titin as one of the genes up-regulated in response to loading.

It has recently been reported that in response to osteogenic stimuli, osteoblasts switch over to oxidative phosphorylation for energy generation <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Major contributors to oxidative phosphorylation are the five complexes of the respiratory chain located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Canonical pathway analysis revealed that in WT tibiae 10 genes linked to complex I, III, IV and V of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway were up-regulated in response to loading. Load also up-regulated 8 out of 10 genes associated with the glycolysis pathway. Thus, the pathways involved in generating cellular energy are up-regulated in response to loading in the WT and WT-OVX context. Genes associated with Glycolysis were down-regulated with loading in tibiae from ER&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT-SN mice. In common with WT, pyruvate metabolism pathways associated genes were down-regulated by loading after 3&#x000a0;h in WT-SN mice.</p><p>We and others have previously shown that mechanical strain induces proliferation of osteoblast-like cells <xref rid="bib82 bib83" ref-type="bibr">[82,83]</xref>.

Cyclin E2 is known to promote the cell cycle progression through G1/S phase transition <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. Consistent with this, cyclin E2 expression was up-regulated in response to loading. The defining feature of S phase is replication of the genome. Histones constitute half the mass of chromatin and play a crucial role in packaging of DNA required for this phase. The synchronized biosynthesis of histones is also regulated by cyclin E2-CDK2 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. Consistent with this finding the transcription of mammalian core histone gene, H4, was up-regulated by loading in WT mouse tibia.</p><p>In addition to activating signaling pathways leading to proliferation, pro-apoptotic gene expression was down-regulated and anti-apoptotic gene expression was up-regulated at 8&#x000a0;h after loading in tibiae from WT mice. This triple pronged response to a pulse of loading would result in a higher number of osteoblasts per bone surface leading load-induced osteogenesis.</p><p>With the exception of <italic>Sost</italic>, which was down-regulated at an earlier time point than in the WT, loading the tibiae of WT-OVX mice did not differentially regulate the expression of the bone-related genes (<italic>Spp1</italic>, <italic>Ostn</italic>, <italic>Postn</italic>, <italic>Timp1</italic>, <italic>Timp2</italic> and <italic>Ctgf</italic>) detected in the loaded WT mice. Consistent with this lack of early response to loading, the expression of osteopontin, <italic>Irs1</italic>, <italic>Gdf2</italic>, <italic>Lrp1</italic>, <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Cd38</italic> was down-regulated. CD38<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are known to display a marked reduction in bone density <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. This divergence in loading-related response was further highlighted by the finding that in contrast to the WT, in the WT-OVX loading did not induce an up-regulation of the genes related to the Glycolysis pathway. On the contrary, they were down-regulated by loading. Although these data argue for a blunted osteogenic response to loading in WT-OVX, this is in contrast to the study of Hagino et al. <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>, which showed that ovariectomy did not change bones' response to loading.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no other reports of a microarray analysis after a brief bone loading session <italic>in vivo</italic> such as that we report here. The most similar study is that reported by Xing et al. <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref> who used microarray to analyze global gene expression in response to a number of periods of loading of the mouse tibia in four-point bone bending. These authors extracted total RNA from the mouse tibiae 24&#x000a0;h after the last loading period. Forty-four of the genes differentially regulated by loading in all 4 backgrounds in our study were also reported to be differentially regulated by Xing et al. Twenty-three of these genes were homologues to the genes differentially regulated over 24&#x000a0;h in WT loaded tibia in our study. These were (procollagen-lysine (<italic>Plod2</italic>), pyruvate dehydrogenase, isozyme 4 (<italic>Pdk4</italic>), <italic>Timp4</italic>, ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6 (<italic>Arl6</italic>), receptor-like tyrosine kinase (<italic>Ryk</italic>), mannose receptor, C type 2 (<italic>Mrc2</italic>), PTPRF interacting protein-binding protein 1 (<italic>Ppfibp1</italic>), lysyl oxidase (<italic>lox</italic>), <italic>Mmp23</italic>, sycoglycan beta (<italic>Sgcb</italic>), <italic>Tnn</italic>, <italic>Timp1</italic>, integral membrane protein 2A (<italic>Itm2a</italic>), FK506-binding protein 9 (<italic>Fkbp9</italic>), vesicle docking protein (<italic>Vdp</italic>), gap junction membrane protein alpha 1 (<italic>Gja1</italic>), cathepsin D (<italic>Ctsd</italic>), AT motif-binding factor (<italic>MAtbf1</italic>), integrin-binding sialoprotein (<italic>Ibsp</italic>), matrilin 2 (<italic>Matn2</italic>), lipase (<italic>Lipc</italic>), <italic>6330577ERik</italic> and <italic>2610024B07Rik</italic>). In common with our study, none of the candidate genes whose expression has been shown in other studies to be regulated by mechanical loading were differentially regulated to a significant level in the study of Xing <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>Recently, Zhang et al. <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref> performed a microarray analysis where joint loading was used to drive bone formation in mouse tibiae. In common with Xing et al., multiple loading sessions were used over three consecutive days and RNA extracted 1&#x000a0;h after the last loading session. Seven of the 25 genes significantly up-regulated in this study were also up-regulated in WT loaded tibiae in our study. These were mas-related gpr (<italic>Mrgpr</italic>), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (<italic>Timp1</italic>), thrombospondin (<italic>Thbs</italic>), procollagen type III alpha1 (<italic>Col3a1</italic>), mast cell protease (<italic>Mmcp</italic>), matrilin 2 (<italic>Matn2</italic>) and proteoglycan 4 (<italic>Prg4</italic>). Since only some of the genes differentially regulated by loading in this study were listed in their manuscript (50 out of 441 genes), it is difficult to make an exact comparison between the studies. However, signaling pathways generated in this study when all the 441 loading-related genes were accounted for showed an overlap with our current study. ECM remodelling, TGF&#x003b2; and Wnt signaling pathways were differentially regulated in both studies. Differences in the loading response among the three studies may partly be due to the three different types of loading regimens used (axial, four-point bending and joint loading as well as single or multiple loading sessions), different sampling compartments of bone used for RNA extraction (cortical only or cortical and trabecular combined) and different sampling time points after the last loading session.</p><p>In summary, a single short period of <italic>in vivo</italic> bone loading, which stimulates an osteogenic response, results in up-regulation and down-regulation in the levels of expression of hundreds of genes within the bones' resident cells over the period from 3 to 24&#x000a0;h after loading. The number and identity of the genes regulated by loading and the timing of their regulation are substantially influenced by context (normal, estrogen deficient, lack of ER&#x003b1; or disuse). Many of the genes differentially regulated within this early loading-related response are not specific to bone but are primarily involved in energy metabolism, cell adhesion and proliferation. In none of the contexts examined were there any loading-induced changes in expression of the iconic candidate mechano-sensitive genes such as IGFs, COX2 and NOS. In the situation of estrogen deficiency caused by ovariectomy and lack of normal functional loading following sciatic neurectomy, artificial loading-induced changes in the expression of genes involved in canonical signaling pathways were generally delayed compared with those in similarly loaded tibiae in WT mice. In mice lacking ER&#x003b1; the loading-related response in terms of gene regulation at all time points was markedly smaller than in any of the other contexts investigated.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>H.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The mechanostat: a proposed pathogenic mechanism of osteoporoses and the bone mass effects of mechanical and nonmechanical agents</article-title><source>Bone Miner.</source><volume>2</volume><year>1987</year><fpage>73</fpage><lpage>85</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3333019</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Wolf J.

Total RNA was extracted from the non-loaded mouse tibiae at the &#x000a0;3-h time point.
