Radiographs of knees and wrists confirmed the presence of florid rickets. The family (including 2 unaffected siblings and the mother) were investigated for hereditary rickets.</p><p>The three affected siblings had biochemical features of hereditary hypophosphataemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) with normal plasma calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, hypophosphataemia, hyperphosphaturia and hypercalciuria. At presentation, two of the three affected siblings had an elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) concentration. The mother and clinically unaffected siblings had largely normal biochemistry.</p><p>Genetic analysis of the SLC34A3 gene, encoding the type IIc sodium-phosphate cotransporter, in DNA samples from the siblings and their mother was conducted. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) S168F, E513V and L599L were identified. E513V and L599L had been previously identified as benign polymorphisms. S168F however, is a previously unreported variant. In silico mutation evaluation predicted that the S168F mutation causes changes in the protein product which are damaging to its function.

Plasma P increased somewhat in S2* but little change was seen in S5*. Problems with treatment compliance were acknowledged and the therapy was subsequently terminated.</p><sec id="s0070"><title>Gene sequencing and screening</title><p>Candidate gene analysis of the SLC34AC gene, encoding a type IIc sodium-phosphate transporter (NaPi-IIc) expressed in the kidney, was conducted in the DNA sample from the youngest affected sibling (S1*) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Three SNPs were found for which the other family members were then screened. Two of the SNPs had been previously reported on the NCBI database and had been assigned the following reference numbers rs28542318 and rs74842953. These SNPs referred to a non-synonymous mutation E513V (c.1538A&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;T) and a synonymous mutation L599L (c.1795&#x000a0;T&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;C) respectively. <italic>In silico</italic> mutation analysis suggested that these two SNPs were benign polymorphisms and they were unique to S1* and were not present in the other investigated family members. The third SNP was a novel non-synonymous mutation resulting in an amino acid change S168F (c.503C&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;T). Blast alignment results indicated that the flanking amino acid regions at the site of the S168F mutation were highly conserved throughout species (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>). In silico mutation analysis predicted that this SNP would cause a damaging mutation in the NaPi-IIc protein, the likely cause being the loss of function of the transmembrane domain spanning 133&#x02013;188 amino acids. Prediction analysis, suggested that the protein product containing S168F was of normal length (599 amino acids) and that the correct reading frame was maintained. The S168F mutation was present homozygously in the affected siblings (S5*, S2* and S1*) and heterozygously in the unaffected family members (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0020"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Republic of The Gambia (latitude 13&#x000b0;N) in West Africa has a hot and dry tropical climate with a single wet season from June to October. There is abundant UVB-containing sunshine throughout the year and a lifestyle that does not limit skin UVB-exposure. Cases of rickets have, however, been reported and have been attributed predominantly to a chronically low dietary calcium (Ca) intake leading to a 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D-driven increase in FGF23 leading to urinary phosphate (P) wasting and rickets <xref rid="bb0005 bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>.</p><p>The family described in this study is, however, strikingly different to our previous reports of rickets in The Gambia. To our knowledge, this study documents the first cases of hereditary hypophosphataemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) in Africa. The cause of HHRH is a mutation within the gene encoding the Type IIc sodium-phosphate co-transporter <xref rid="bb0015 bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>. There are two major NaPi co-transporters involved in P reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. These are NaPi-Type IIa and -Type IIc, both of which are regulated by FGF23 and PTH. Although NaPi-IIa is thought to account for up to 70% of renal P reabsorption <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, we show in this study that NaPi-IIc must also play an integral role in P homeostasis. Additionally, we describe a novel mutation in the SLC34AC gene.</p><p>HHRH is associated with a distinct biochemical profile resulting from the loss of function of NaPi-IIc. This includes a reduction in P reabsorption in the renal tubules leading to excessive urinary P loss. A low TmP:GFR and plasma P are characteristic of this syndrome which is often associated with an elevated 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and consequent hypercalciuria. A raised FGF23 is not a distinguishing feature of this syndrome, however we found elevated FGF23 at first presentation with rickets in 2 out of 3 cases. This may be explained by a chronically low dietary Ca intake and increased 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D-driven increase in FGF23 as described in the majority of Gambian nutritional rickets <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Alternatively, this may have been due, in part, to the young age of these children (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;y) as we have previously seen that FGF23 tends to decrease throughout childhood (unpublished data). However the FGF23 Z-scores, calculated using local age-matched control children, were high at 2.5 and 1.2. It may also, however, be an indicator of poor iron status leading to an increased expression of the FGF23 gene and a subsequent increase in degradation of the intact FGF23 hormone <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, this possibility cannot be explored in greater detail as the C-terminal assay and not the Intact FGF23 assay was used to measure FGF23 concentration in this study.</p><p>Some studies on HHRH cohorts, have shown that heterozygous carriers of the mutation, although asymptomatic, may present with hypercalciuria which puts them at a higher risk of developing nephrocalcinosis <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. We have shown that all investigated family members had varying degrees of hypercalciuria with <italic>u</italic>Ca:<italic>u</italic>Cr values ranging from 0.15 to 1.05&#x000a0;mol/mol. However, the presence or absence of nephrocalcinosis could not be determined because of the lack of the availability of renal ultrasound. Additionally, an interesting feature of both the clinically affected and unaffected members of the family is that they are consistently shorter and tended to be heavier than their healthy yet undernourished peers. This may well be a function of their familial environment, or perhaps an additional feature of the mutation.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we have only described in silico predictions of the protein containing the novel S168F mutation, located within a highly conserved region, leading to a loss of function of the translated NaPi-IIc protein. Additional mutational analysis is required to determine more detailed effects of this mutation on the protein function and the prevalence of the variant allele needs to be further explored in the general Gambian population. Nevertheless, we have clearly shown that the affected siblings were homozygous in the S168F mutation, whereas the unaffected family members were carriers.</p><p>In summary, this study presents a novel mutation in the SLC34AC gene causing HHRH. This is the first kindred of HHRH to be reported in Africa.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>All authors state that they have no conflicts of
