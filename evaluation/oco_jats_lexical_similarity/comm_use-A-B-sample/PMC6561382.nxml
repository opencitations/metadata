In a substantial number of patients there is progressive fibrosis of the alveoli and interstitium that leads to increasing disability and ultimately the death of patients with these diseases. Establishing the aetiology of these fibrotic lung diseases is often a clinical challenge and the relevance of aetiology to disease behaviour remains controversial. The best characterised fibrotic ILD is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which has a median survival of 3 years, and 5-year survival of 25%, which is worse than most cancers.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Other conditions characterised by progressive pulmonary fibrosis include asbestosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD (RA-ILD), where the aetiology is assumed, and unclassifiable ILD where the clinical phenotype does not precisely reflect IPF.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The progression of these related conditions is also remorseless, and their genetic predisposition similar to IPF, raising the possibility of shared targetable mechanisms across disease phenotypes regardless of likely aetiology.</p><p>Recently two drugs, pirfenidone<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> and nintedanib,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> have been approved for the treatment of IPF. While these drugs are described as &#x02018;anti-fibrotic&#x02019;, they can only be prescribed for IPF, rather than all forms of progressive fibrotic disease.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Therefore, patients with pulmonary fibrosis where the aetiology has been assumed, or the clinical features aren&#x02019;t specific for IPF, cannot receive antifibrotic therapy at the current time. However, the risk factors and molecular pathways driving fibrosis in aetiologically defined or phenotypically unusual pulmonary fibrosis may be similar to IPF, thus potentially resulting in a large number of patients not having access to life-prolonging therapy. Our understanding of IPF has improved significantly both in terms of biomarkers<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> and clinical end points.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of non-IPF ILD, with currently no approved treatments or cure.</p><p>RA-ILD, seen in 5%&#x02013;10% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis remains a significant life-limiting complication with mortality in excess of 10% compared with patients without ILD. Subclinical interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) are seen in 30%&#x02013;50% but individual risk of progression to ILD is unknown.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Chronic HP diagnosis rests on history of antigen exposure and radiological appearance, which often has an overlap with other ILDs. Sometimes, there is no known antigen exposure, and more recent hypotheses suggest a combination of exposure in genetically predisposed individuals.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> While acute HP has a good prognosis, chronic HP is a progressive disease lacking evidence-based treatments with current therapy relying on immunosuppression. Despite improvements in radiology and the advent of multidisciplinary teams (MDTs), unclassifiable ILD remains a significant burden of ILD in clinical practice and represents between 10% and 38% of all ILDs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> These patients present a diagnostic challenge and again no evidence-based treatments are available.</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted phenotypical and molecular similarities across a range of ILDs. For example, the minor allele frequency of the MUC5B promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), widely associated with IPF,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> is found with increasing frequency in patients with chronic HP.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Short telomeres have also been associated with RA-ILD<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and chronic HP, resulting in a prognosis similar to patients with IPF.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Patients with RA-ILD and usual interstitial pneumonia pattern have radiological changes that are indistinguishable from IPF and the presence of traction change and honeycombing is associated with poor outcomes regardless of aetiology.</p><p>Together, these features suggest that there may be shared mechanisms in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis common among patients with lung fibrosis due to a number of aetiologies. To explore this hypothesis, the Its Not JUST Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Study (INJUSTIS) will recruit a clinical cohort comprising of ILD subgroups, to explore genetic, serum and clinical biomarkers that may distinguish progressive fibrosing lung disease phenotypes regardless of aetiology. This may then eventually enable therapeutics targeting specific mechanisms of disease rather than clinical phenotypes of disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Objectives</title><p>INJUSTIS is a prospective multicentre observational cohort study that will be managed through the Nottingham Respiratory Research Unit and funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) through the Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre and an NIHR professorship (RGJ).</p><p>The primary objective is to:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Identify biomarkers that determine progressive fibrotic lung disease irrespective of aetiology.</p></list-item></list><p>The secondary objectives are to:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Identify biomarkers that predict all-cause mortality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identify biomarkers that predict changes in QoL scores.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identify biomarkers that predict the development of disease complications (respiratory failure and acute exacerbations).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Investigate genetic association and epigenetic modifications which affect fibrotic disease severity and progression.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Prospectively evaluate longitudinal disease behaviour in patients with non-IPF fibrotic lung diseases with a view to developing composite clinical end points for subsequent use in intervention studies.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Explore association of environmental exposures with disease progression and all-cause mortality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Investigate whether home handheld spirometry over 3 months predicts disease progression and survival.</p></list-item></list><p>The primary end point will be:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Disease progression defined as relative forced vital capacity decline &#x02265;10% or death within 12 months.</p></list-item></list><p>Secondary end points are:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All-cause mortality at time of censoring.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Number of acute exacerbations over 2 years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire Scores from baseline to 12 weeks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Rate of change in biomarker activity from baseline to 12 weeks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) from baseline to 12 months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in 6 min walk distance from baseline to 12 months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in transcriptomic profiles from baseline to 12 weeks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in home handheld spirometry values from baseline to 12 weeks.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Selection of participants</title><p>Two hundred participants with recently diagnosed (within 18 months of study start date) fibrotic lung disease (50 each of rheumatoid-ILD, asbestosis, chronic HP and unclassifiable ILD) and 50 IPF participants as positive controls will be recruited from ILD clinics locally and across the UK.

Sample analysis will take place either at the University of Nottingham or in the laboratories of third party national, or international, academic partners or contract research organisations following appropriate tissue transfer agreements.</p><p>The primary analysis will include measurement of epithelial biomarkers [matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), surfactant protein D (SP-D)]) and markers of matrix turnover [C-reactive protein degraded by MMP-1/8 (CRPM), collagen 3 degraded by MMP-9 (C3M) and collagen 6 degraded by MMP-2/9 (C6M)) as well as genotyping for mucin 5B (<italic>MUC5B)</italic>, desmoplakin (<italic>DSP)</italic> and A-kinase anchoring protein 13 (<italic>AKAP13)</italic>.

Participants will be trained to undertake daily spirometry readings (one forced expiratory manoeuvre/day; seated) for the first 3 months of the study period. All spirometry readings will be blinded to participants and automatically uploaded to patientMpower via the smartphone application, ensuring full encryption throughout. Participants will therefore need to possess, and be confident in using, a smartphone device and have an email address. The spirometry data will then be transferred to the University of Nottingham for further analysis. Participants will be able to continue to use the spirometer and patientMpower application with open display of FVC readings after the initial 3-month observation period if they wish.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Statistics</title><p>The primary end point of disease progression (10% relative FVC decline or death within 12 months) will be used dichotomously across all subgroups collectively analysed together, with the exception of IPF controls. Association of baseline biomarker levels with dichotomous disease progression and overall survival will be analysed using binomial family of generalised linear models, while Gaussian family or otherwise appropriate models will be used to assess associations with continuous secondary end points. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure will be applied to account for multiplicity as appropriate. Repeated measures mixed models will be used to assess associations over time, which includes time points within one model and circumvents correction for multiple testing. Fixed factors will include baseline demographic information. Where putative biomarkers are identified, end point data will be used to compare biomarker levels by time-to-event through proportional hazard models; comparable ability to predict end points will be assessed through sensitivity and specificity analyses (receiver operator characteristic curves).</p><p>To identify transcriptomic biomarkers, RNA-seq libraries will be prepared and entered into a workflow for read count normalisation enabling quantification of transcript expression; normalisation ensures length and abundance of cDNA reads are corrected according to other genes (reads per kilobase per million) and further library scaling can occur.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> Libraries, aligned to an appropriate reference genome, will enable detection of differential gene expression and SNPs/variants according to primary end point and secondary measures of disease severity. Transcript-discovery artefacts, transcripts that remain below detectable levels of change across compared samples, as well as any with zero mapped reads will be excluded. R statistical packages will be used for these bioinformatics workflows.</p><p>Further statistical analyses will be performed to determine associations between identified biomarkers and exploratory secondary objectives. Statistical approaches include, but are not limited to, correlation and analyses of variance between biomarker levels and patient-reported QoL outcomes or disease exacerbations; machine learning strategies on home spirometry to detect decline in lung function, and subsequent comparison of sensitivity with traditional spirometry measures at predicting end points. Factor analysis approaches will be used to reduce dimensions of data sets and assess clustering; generalised linear models will be used to test associations.</p><p>Confounding factors are particularly important in studies that hope to offer causal inference of biomarkers on clinical outcomes,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and corrections to adjust for these will be applied in the analysis as proposed by the directed acyclic graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Fixed factors in mixed models will include baseline demographic information: age, gender, body mass index and smoking status. Exposure history in patients with chronic HP will be collected as will time from diagnosis to enrolment across all subgroups and adjusted for as a potential confounder. Some participants may be on background therapies such as immunosuppression and corticosteroids. While these therapies are likely to be confounders, it is possible they may decrease or increase progression of fibrosis based on the PANTHER (Prednisone, Azathioprine, and <italic>N</italic>-Acetylcysteine: A Study That Evaluates Response in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) Study.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Therefore, models will include treatment strategy as part of the minimal set of adjustment for estimating direct effect on end point. The objectives of the study do not extend to assessing treatment effect.

MMP7 was selected for power calculation as the most conservative of the biomarkers identified in the PROFILE Study, with the lowest threshold for biomarker change and least statistical precision, thus powering on MMP7 ensures that other biomarkers will be analysed with adequate power. The calculation demonstrates that a sample of 100 participants with progressive fibrosis and 100 with stable fibrosis will be large enough to detect dynamic differences in biomarkers over 3 months with 80% power and a type I error rate of 5% (&#x003b1;=0.05). Therefore 200 participants with ILD will be recruited assuming 50% disease progression. Fifty positive IPF controls will be recruited to take part in the study to benchmark progressive fibrotic lung disease but will not be included in the final analysis.</p><p>The study is also appropriately powered for genetic risk scores. An individual SNP with 25% minor allele frequency would have &#x0003e;70% power to detect an OR of 1.8 for stable versus progressive disease. The power for a risk score comprising multiple variants is expected to be greater. This assumes an additive genetic model, p&#x0003c;0.05, in 100 stable versus 100 progressive patients whereby with each additional marker added to the model the power is actually increased rather than reduced. The markers used will all be defined a priori based on data obtained from the PROFILE Study<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> but are likely to include MUC5B, DSP, AKAP13, SP-D, CA-125, CA19-9, MMP-7, CRPM and C6M.</p><p>Following the recruitment of 100 participants who complete 1 year in the study, an interim sample size re-estimation by an independent data monitoring committee will be conducted to determine the progression status between blinded subgroups. If the blinded progression status is approximately 50%, recruitment will continue as described. If however, any subgroups show a relatively stable phenotype they will be excluded from subsequent recruitment, after being unblinded to the data monitoring committee. To attain an adequately powered sample size with 50% progressive fibrosis, further recruitment will be enriched with participants from the progressive phenotypical subgroups relative to rate of progression in interim analysis. Those recruited from subsequently excluded subgroups will be removed from the primary analysis, as they will be sources of inconsistency. However, if all subgroups progress at a substantially lower rate than expected and conditional power calculations at interim analysis suggest futility then all subgroups will be included in an analysis that demonstrates the null hypothesis (fibrotic lung disease progress at a rate specific to aetiology) could not be rejected. The study is not statistically powered to detect differences between ILD subgroups, although exploratory analyses will be carried out to inform future studies and support replication studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>The Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis (APF)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> charity have been consulted during the design of the study and will sit on the steering committee as patient representatives, which will inform study conduct and recruitment.
