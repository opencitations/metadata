Significant progress in its pathophysiology and treatment has been achieved in the last decade. Immune cells and innate cytokines have been suggested to be crucial in the pathogenesis of AS, especially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)&#x02011;B27 and the interleukin&#x02011;23/17 axis. However, the pathogenesis of AS remains unclear. The current study reviewed the etiology and pathogenesis of AS, including genome-wide association studies and cytokine pathways.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a type of SpA, is an autoimmune disease that mainly involves spine joints, sacroiliac joints (SIJs) and their adjacent soft tissues, such as tendons and ligaments. In more advanced cases, this inflammation can lead to fibrosis and calcification, resulting in the loss of flexibility and the fusion of the spine, resembling &#x0201c;bamboo&#x0201d; with an immobile position. The main clinical manifestations include back pain and progressive spinal rigidity as well as inflammation of the hips, shoulders, peripheral joints and fingers/toes. In addition, there are extra-articular manifestations, such as acute anterior uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, these extra-articular manifestations differ between East Asian and Caucasian populations. In a study involving 988 patients with ankylosing spondylitis in east Asia, only 0.4% developed inflammatory bowel disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> However, in some analyses performed in Western countries, ~5%&#x02013;10% of patients with AS present with inflammatory bowel disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup></p><p id="Par3">The prevalence of AS has a clear correlation with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positive rate in specific populations. Studies have revealed that in HLA-B27-positive populations, the prevalence rate of AS is ~5%&#x02013;6%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> In a 2009 national survey in the United States, the prevalence of HLA-B27-positive populations varied in different ethnic communities, with 7.5%, 4.6%, and 1.1% in non-Hispanic whites, Mexican-Americans, and non-Hispanic blacks, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> In the literature, males reportedly account for the vast majority of cases of AS, while the incidence among men and women is similar in nonradiographic axial spondyloarthropathy (nr-axSpA), which refers to individuals meeting clinical criteria for axSpA without radiological evidence of sacroiliitis. A meta-analysis including eight studies including 2 236 patients with AS and 1 242 patients with nr-axSpA revealed that males accounted for 70.4% of AS patients and 46.5% of patients with nr-axSpA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Genetic susceptibility results have shown the following recurrent risk factors in different generations of relatives: monozygotic (MZ) twins, 63% (17/27); first-generation relatives, 8.2% (441/5 390); second-generation relatives, 1.0% (8/834); and third-generation relatives, 0.7% (7/997).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">Available criteria sets are frequently used in clinical practice to help clinicians make diagnoses. Currently, the most widely applied diagnostic classification of AS is the modified New York (mNY) criteria. In this classification system, a patient needs to meet at least one clinical criterion and the radiological diagnosis of AS. Another classification is Amor criteria and European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) criteria for diagnosing AS. In 2012, AV Tubergen discussed the different classification criteria sets for AS and SpA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> In addition, the ASAS criteria, the dominant diagnostic criteria for axSpA, have gained popularity in Europe (2016 update of the ASAS-EULAR management recommendations for axial spondyloarthritis). As clinicians seemed to have difficulty differentiating AS and SpA, Joel D. Taurog established an algorithm for the diagnosis or exclusion of axSpA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">The confusion in diagnosis and lack of disease-modifying therapeutics, including anti-TNF-&#x003b1; and anti-IL-17 treatment of AS, are largely due to the limited knowledge of the pathogenesis, which may involve immunity, heredity and other factors. In this paper, we reviewed the etiology of AS, current investigations of its pathogenesis and available treatments.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Etiology</title><p id="Par6">As an autoimmune disease, AS develops through complex interactions between genetic background and environmental factors. Although significant progress has been achieved in the past decades, the etiology of AS remains unclear to some extent. To date, studies have revealed some factors that may be related to the occurrence of AS, including genetic background, immune reaction, microbial infection, and endocrinal abnormity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genetic background</title><p id="Par7">Genetic factors have been acknowledged as crucial in the genesis of AS. The correlation between AS and genetics has been a perpetual topic since hereditary factors of AS were first confirmed within families in 1961.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Twin studies have revealed significantly higher concordance between monozygotic twins (63%) than between dizygotic twins (23%). Genetic effects have been identified as pathogenic factors that contribute to over 90% of the population variance for AS manifestations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> One of the most important genetic factors is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I allele HLA-B27, which was discovered in 1973.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Despite the unclear pathomechanism, HLA-B27 has been associated with the prevalence of AS in different populations around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Studies have shown that 90%&#x02013;95% of AS patients are HLA-B27 positive, while 1%&#x02013;2% of HLA-B27-positive populations develop AS. This number increased to 15%&#x02013;20% for those with an affected first-degree relative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> The familial tendency of AS was remarkable with relative risks of 94, 25, and 4 for first-, second-, and third-degree relatives, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> In addition to the association with the genesis of AS, HLA-B27-positive patients showed a significantly lower average onset age and a higher prevalence of acute anterior uveitis than did HLA-B27-negative patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> HLA-B27 has a high degree of polymorphism. Over 100 subtypes have been identified thus far,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> with differing prevalence rates among different ethnicities, especially between those of East Asian and Caucasian descent. As reported, the most prevalent subtypes in AS are HLA-B2705 (Caucasian populations), HLA-B2704 (Chinese populations), and HLA-B2702 (Mediterranean populations).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> By contrast, two subtypes, HLA-B2706 and HLA-B2709, seem unrelated to AS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> In addition, genetic influence is not alone in the development of AS. HLA-B27-transgenic rat studies on &#x003b2;2 microglobulin (&#x003b2;2m),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> a noncovalent part of the MHC-I complex, has proven that additional &#x003b2;2m reduces HLA-B27 misfolding and promotes arthritis and spondylitis, implying that B27 misfolding is associated with intestinal inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> This result suggested that abnormal &#x003b2;2m can coordinate with HLA-B27 in AS development, which may be explained by protein misfolding theories and will be discussed later in the pathogenesis section.</p><p id="Par8">Even as the most emphasized genetic factor, the overall contribution of HLA-B27 to AS heritability is only ~20%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> indicating that other genetic influences contribute to AS. With the progress of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and other technologies, non-HLA-B27 and even non-HLA genes have been identified in AS in recent years; basically, the genetic differences between various ethnicities have been explored and compared in recent years. HLA-B60 is related to HLA-B27-negative AS and increases the disease susceptibility by 3&#x02013;6-fold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> An analysis in a Taiwanese population suggested that the interaction between HLA-B60 and HLA-B27 could be a better marker for the risk of AS susceptibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> HLA-B7,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> HLA-B16, HLA-B35,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> HLA-B38 and HLA-B39<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> have also been associated with HLA-B27-negative AS in various ethnicities with unknown mechanisms. A study of 1 000 AS patients and 1 500 heathy individuals reported an initial association and independent replication of two new loci related to AS, <italic>ERAP1</italic> (also known as <italic>ARTS1</italic>) and <italic>IL23R</italic>, in a North American sample and provided preliminary evidence for several non-MHC nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Another study including GWAS of 2 053 AS patients and 5 140 controls presented SNPs in two gene deserts at 2p15 [rs10865331; combined <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10(&#x02212;19)] and 21q22 [rs2242944; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10(&#x02212;20)], as well as in the genes <italic>ANTXR2</italic> [rs4333130; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10(&#x02212;8)] and <italic>IL1R2</italic> [rs2310173; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10(&#x02212;7)].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Many GWASs have been performed in Caucasian and East Asian populations, focusing on genetic polymorphisms of AS susceptibility. One of these studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> genotyped 69 non-MHC AS-associated SNPs and found that six loci (rs6759298, rs2297518, rs75301646, rs12615545, rs5837881, and rs27044) showed significant differences in both Caucasian and EA populations, with rs6759298 located in a &#x02018;gene desert&#x02019; at chromosome 2p15 exhibiting the highest significance. However, genetic differences in several SNPs have been identified. For example, rs27980 and rs7711564 in <italic>ERAP1</italic> previously identified in Caucasian descent were significantly associated with AS in Han Chinese, while no association was shown for <italic>ERAP1</italic> SNPs such as rs27044.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>IL23R</italic> (rs11209026), widely considered a major AS-associated SNP in Europe, showed no significance in a Chinese AS population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> These studies on non-HLA-B27 genes and SNPs indicated a difference in the mechanism of disease pathogenesis between various ethnicities and may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of AS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Immunological and microbial factors</title><p id="Par9">AS is related to a series of autoimmune diseases, including IBD, anterior uveitis and psoriasis, which suggests that they may share a genetic basis and some common immunological processes. The differences observed in immune cells and cytokines in AS suggest the role of immunological effects in AS pathogenesis. In the peripheral blood of AS patients and healthy HLA-B27-positive controls, the levels of T cells secreting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; were reportedly lower. CD8+ T cells in AS patients tended to secrete more IL-10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> Other findings have also demonstrated immunological influences in AS development, which is discussed in the following section.</p><p id="Par10">Microbial infection acts as a triggering factor of the host innate immune system and AS development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> HLA-B27 transgenic rats failed to develop features of SpA in a germ-free environment, which changed when commensal bacteria were introduced into the germ-free models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> suggesting possible interactions between HLA-B27 and the microbiome.

In 2002, the yearly mean total (direct and productivity) costs of AS were US$6,720 per patient in the USA and Euro 9 462 per patient in Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR264">264</xref></sup> There is no effective disease-modifying treatment largely due to the unclear pathogenesis. This review focuses on the etiology, pathogenesis and treatment progress of AS. The etiology of ankylosing spondylitis may be related to genetic background, immune function, pathogenic infection, endocrine abnormalities and other factors. HLA-B27 is the gene crucial to the development of ankylosing spondylitis, while the non-HLA-B27 gene is also important in its pathogenesis. Genetic differences between various ethnicities, particularly East Asian and Caucasian descent, have been noted through GWASs and may shed light on therapeutic strategies. Certain autoimmune diseases and microbial infections also contribute to ankylosing spondylitis, suggesting that they may have a common immune and genetic basis. In addition, the possible causes include hormone abnormalities and changes in vitamin D levels.</p><p id="Par49">The pathogenesis of AS is very complex. Current studies suggest that it may be the result of a variety of complicated mechanisms. In the pathogenesis of AS, various hypotheses, such as the false folding hypothesis, attempt to elucidate the role of HLA-B27. Other non-HLA-B27 genes may influence the occurrence of ankylosing spondylitis through immune function and gene interaction. Overexpression of ERAP1 and ERAP2 is also considered an important pathogenesis of AS. Many factors and related genes in this pathway are constantly being discovered. In addition, related research has focused on the disorder of the IL-23/IL-17 axis and the abnormality of lymphocyte activation and differentiation. Most immune cells and cytokines reportedly participate in the pathogenesis of AS. In particular, the IL-23/IL-17 pathway plays a crucial role in the development of the disease. At present, the pathogenesis of AS is considered to mainly involve immune T cells, while B cells are also slightly involved. There are some studies on the pathogenesis of AS mediated by B cells, and related studies may be strengthened in the future. Alternatively, researchers may continue to explore the correlation among cytokines and immune cells and diseases to predict the occurrence, development and severity of disease. Although the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis is not yet clear, the existing research results can have a certain guiding significance for clinical practice.</p><p id="Par50">The treatment of AS is mainly composed of drug and surgical treatment. In clinic, NSAIDs and TNF-alpha inhibitors are the main drugs for AS. Moreover, interleukin receptor blockers and some drugs that inhibit new bone formation have received increased attention and become the focus of future research, including IL-6 receptor inhibitor sarilumab and Wnt signal pathway inhibitors. Once AS is not effectively controlled, more severe deformities may appear, and surgical treatment is needed. For severe spinal deformities, spinal surgery is required. For sacroiliac joint lesions, total hip arthroplasty is needed. Treatment of AS has always been the center of research all over the world. Currently, the research hotspot of surgical treatment of AS focuses on the choice of surgical path, perioperative management, and the prevention and treatment of complications, especially HO. With scientific and technological development, early diagnosis and effective treatment of AS will be possible. The socioeconomic burden of AS will be significantly reduced, and patients' suffering will be alleviated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation youth project (7184325) and the China Postdoctoral Foundation NO.62 general program.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par51">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>C-R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Rare occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease in a cohort of Han Chinese ankylosing spondylitis patients- a single institute study</article-title><source>Sci.
