Critical roles of GPCRs have been established in bone development, remodeling, and disease. Multiple human GPCR mutations impair bone development or metabolism, resulting in osteopathologies. Here we summarize the disease phenotypes and dysfunctions caused by GPCR gene mutations in humans as well as by deletion in animals. To date, 92 receptors (5 glutamate family, 67 rhodopsin family, 5 adhesion, 4 frizzled/taste2 family, 5 secretin family, and 6 other 7TM receptors) have been associated with bone diseases and dysfunctions (36 in humans and 72 in animals). By analyzing data from these 92 GPCRs, we found that mutation or deletion of different individual GPCRs could induce similar bone diseases or dysfunctions, and the same individual GPCR mutation or deletion could induce different bone diseases or dysfunctions in different populations or animal models. Data from human diseases or dysfunctions identified 19 genes whose mutation was associated with human BMD: 9 genes each for human height and osteoporosis; 4 genes each for human osteoarthritis (OA) and fracture risk; and 2 genes each for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), periodontitis, osteosarcoma growth, and tooth development. Reports from gene knockout animals found 40 GPCRs whose deficiency reduced bone mass, while deficiency of 22 GPCRs increased bone mass and BMD; deficiency of 8 GPCRs reduced body length, while 5 mice had reduced femur size upon GPCR deletion. Furthermore, deficiency in 6 GPCRs induced osteoporosis; 4 induced osteoarthritis; 3 delayed fracture healing; 3 reduced arthritis severity; and reduced bone strength, increased bone strength, and increased cortical thickness were each observed in 2 GPCR-deficiency models. The ever-expanding number of GPCR mutation-associated diseases warrants accelerated molecular analysis, population studies, and investigation of phenotype correlation with SNPs to elucidate GPCR function in human diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bone quality and biomechanics</kwd><kwd>Osteoporosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81722020, 91749204, 81472048</award-id><award-id>81330049</award-id><award-id>81330059, 81572640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Mingyao</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Jianru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17JC1400903, 17411950300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Jianru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Bone development and bone remodeling are processes primarily governed by osteoblast, osteoclast, and chondrocyte differentiation and activity. Fetal bone development proceeds through two courses, intramembranous ossification (typical in flat bone formation) and endochondral ossification (primarily in long bones). Intramembranous ossification is largely influenced by mesenchymal cell differentiation into mature osteoblasts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> while endochondral ossification is driven by mesenchymal cell differentiation into chondrocytes, which then undergo hypertrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Bone remodeling occurs throughout life and involves resorption of mature bone tissue by osteoclasts, which differentiate from hematopoietic cell precursors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and new bone tissue formation by osteoblasts, which arise from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each cell type is regulated by assorted hormones and paracrine factors. These factors determine the relative rates of bone formation and resorption, processes whose homeostasis is critical to prevent bone structure damage, and consequent metabolic bone diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Bone cells and bone remodeling. Bone is continuously remodeled to maintain tissue integrity. Remodeling begins with old bone resorption by osteoclasts, which differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells. Following resorption, unclassified macrophage-like cells, which are also from hematopoietic stem cells, are found at the remodeling site in the intermediate or reversal phase. Osteoblast precursors, which arise from mesenchymal stem cells, are then recruited and proliferate and differentiate into mature osteoblasts and secrete new bone matrix.

Our results show that 92 receptors (5 glutamate family, 67 rhodopsin family, 5 adhesion, 4 frizzled/taste2 family, 5 secretin family, and 6 other 7TM reporters) were associated with bone diseases and dysfunctions (35 in humans and 72 in animals), and the catalog of diseases linked to GPCR malfunction continues to expand.</p><p id="Par46">In summary, the GPCR superfamily plays a key role in regulating bone diseases and remodeling. Different GPCRs from different subfamilies may have similar physiological functions to regulate these processes; however, the same GPCR may have different physiological functions in different populations or animal models. Although the field has made significant progress in understanding how GPCRs influence bone development and diseases, much remains unknown. Since many GPCR mutations are embryonic lethal, the availability of mouse models to study GPCRs has been a significant barrier to progress. Fortunately, conditional knockout approaches have proven effective in many cases, allowing characterization of the detailed mechanisms involving GPCRs in bone diseases and dysfunctions. This should allow enormous advances in translational medicine, as GPCRs are generally regarded as a superb class of drug targets.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1105102 to J.L., 2016YFC0902102 to J.L. and J.X.), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81722020, 91749204, 81472048 to J.L., 81330049 to M.L., 81330059 and 81572640 to J.X.), the Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (14ZZ051 to J.L., 2017ZZ01017 to J.X.), the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (12ZR1447900 to J.L., 17JC1400903 and 17411950300 to J.X.), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (to J.L.).</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par47">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ducy</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Schinke</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Karsenty</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The osteoblast: a sophisticated fibroblast under central surveillance</article-title><source>Science</source><year>2000</year><volume>289</volume><fpage>1501</fpage><lpage>1504</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1126/science.289.5484.1501</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10968779</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ornitz</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Marie</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>FGF signaling pathways in endochondral and intramembranous bone development and human genetic disease</article-title><source>Genes Dev.</source><year>2002</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>1446</fpage><lpage>1465</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1101/gad.990702</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12080084</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boyle</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Simonet</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lacey</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Osteoclast differentiation and activation</article-title><source>Nature</source><year>2003</year><volume>423</volume><fpage>337</fpage><lpage>342</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/nature01658</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12748652</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Teitelbaum</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>FP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Genetic regulation of osteoclast development and function</article-title><source>Nat.
