Although this tissue type is easily accessed by a surgeon, it has a low frequency of MSCs, which is significant given the high cell numbers required for bone regeneration strategies. Lipoaspirates possess higher MSC frequencies, albeit cells with a differentiation profile less suited to orthopaedic interventions. Intra-medullary cavities of long bones have previously been shown to harbour MSCs in animals, however evaluation of their frequency, differentiation capacity and phenotype in humans had not previously been performed.</p><p>Long bone fatty bone marrow (LBFBM) was collected prior to harvesting bone graft. Basic cellular compositions of donor-matched LBFBM and ICBM aspirates, including the numbers of CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells and CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells, were similar. MSCs were enumerated using colony-forming-unit-fibroblast assays and flow cytometry for the presence of a resident LBFBM CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup> CD271<sup>+</sup> MSC population and revealed a trend for higher MSC numbers (average 5 fold, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) per millilitre of LBFBM compared to donor-matched ICBM. Functional characteristics of resident MSCs, including their growth rates, differentiation potentials and surface phenotypes (CD73<sup>+</sup>CD105<sup>+</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup>) before and after culture-amplification, were similar. Enhanced numbers of MSCs could be recovered following brief enzymatic treatment of solid fragments of LBFBM.</p><p>Our findings therefore reveal that the intramedullary cavity of the human femur is a depot of MSCs, which, although closely associated with fat, have a differentiation profile equivalent to ICBM. This anatomical site is frequently accessed by the orthopaedic/trauma surgeon and aspiration of the intramedullary cavity represents a &#x02018;low-tech&#x02019; method of harvesting potentially large numbers of MSCs for regenerative therapies and research.</p><p><bold>This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: <italic>Interactions Between Bone, Adipose Tissue and Metabolism</italic>.</bold></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Multipotential stromal cells</kwd><kwd>Mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>Long bone</kwd><kwd>Bone marrow</kwd><kwd>Intramedullary cavity</kwd><kwd>Bone regeneration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p>Edited by: Clifford Rosen</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>The iliac crest bone marrow aspirate (ICBMA) was the first source from which multipotential stromal cells (MSCs), also termed mesenchymal stem cells, were isolated <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This anatomical site has become the most frequently accessed in harvesting MSCs for bone tissue engineering and is generally accepted as the &#x02018;gold-standard&#x02019;. Whilst this source is readily accessible and has good handling properties it has a low frequency of MSCs (0.001&#x02013;0.01%) <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This is of significance as many regenerative medicine uses of MSCs including putative bone repair applications require large cell numbers <xref rid="bb0010 bb0015 bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[2&#x02013;4]</xref>. High MSC yields can be achieved by <italic>in vitro</italic> culture with relative ease, with a 1000-fold increase in numbers within 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;weeks <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, this results in daughter cells that have reduced differentiation capacity <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and impaired cell function including gradual accumulation of senescence-related markers <xref rid="bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref> and increased potential for transformation <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This process is also time-inefficient, expensive and requires industrial-scale good-manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible cell expansion facilities and a two-stage surgery for tissue procurement and implantation <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Due to these factors there is a need to find alternative MSC sources where there is a potentially larger yield of cells. Initial techniques involved the development of devices to concentrate MSCs from large volumes of ICBM aspirate by centrifugation <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02014; and such devices are available in the clinic. The implantation of 50,000 uncultured MSCs/CFU-Fs by concentrating up to 300&#x000a0;ml of ICBMA has shown an improvement of fracture healing in one study <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, it is not always possible to obtain such large amounts of ICBMA. The enzymatic digestion of adipose-rich connective tissues such as fat has been proposed as an alternative strategy, with authors reporting the liberation of 500-fold more MSCs per gram of tissue when compared with ICBMA <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Lipoaspiration however cannot be performed for every orthopedic patient and the &#x0201c;quality&#x0201d; of lipoaspirate-derived MSCs for bone repair applications remains debatable <xref rid="bb0060 bb0065 bb0070 bb0075 bb0080 bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[12&#x02013;17]</xref>.</p><p>Multipotential stromal cells have previously been shown to be present in the intramedullary cavity of long bones in humans <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, this has been largely ignored as a source of MSCs for bone regeneration. In contrast, the harvesting of long-bone BM has been practiced on rat <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, mouse <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, rabbit <xref rid="bb0105 bb0110 bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[21&#x02013;23]</xref> and pig <xref rid="bb0120 bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[24,25]</xref> and is probably the most prevalent research method of isolating MSCs from animals. Analogous to other adipose-rich tissues, it may be hypothesized that the intra-medullary (IM) contents of long bones contain large numbers of MSCs. Unlike peripheral fat tissues, the MSCs are present in a bone related micro-environment and may potentially exhibit good intrinsic osteogenic capabilities. This is supported by early pioneering findings documenting a strong <italic>in vivo</italic> osteogenic capacity of adipogenic marrow cells <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>This study explored the aspirated contents from the IM cavities of long bones, which are frequently accessed by the trauma/orthopaedic surgeon, as a source of MSCs in comparison to the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; iliac crest aspirated source. We used colony-forming fibroblast (CFU-F) assay <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and flow cytometry for CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> fraction <xref rid="bb0135 bb0140 bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[27&#x02013;29]</xref> to enumerate MSCs and compared their frequency with donor-matched ICBM aspirates. We also used functional <italic>in vitro</italic> assays for MSC expansion and differentiation, to demonstrate that MSCs from IM cavities of long bones were equal or superior to their ICBMA counterparts. These findings should permit the development of novel one-step MSC harvesting procedures for bone repair augmentation in fracture patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Subjects and specimen collection</title><p>Approval for these studies was obtained from the Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS trust ethics committee, with all patients providing informed consent. For the purpose of this research, iliac crest bone marrow aspirate (ICBMA) was obtained from 11 acute trauma patients, 11 patients with post-traumatic disorders, 15 patients with long bone (tibia/femur) non-union fractures and 6 healthy controls (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Samples were harvested from patients during operation; ICBMA (10&#x000a0;ml) was aspirated from the anterior iliac crest, using an 11-gauge, bevel-tipped trocar (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, US) and 10&#x000a0;ml syringe (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). Donor-matched ICBMA and LBFBM material was collected from 8 patients with non-union fractures (median age 35&#x000a0;years, range 19&#x02013;65).</p><p>The LBFBM contents were aspirated via the greater trochanter, which was opened surgically, prior to the harvest of bone graft using the reamer&#x02013;irrigator&#x02013;aspirator (RIA) (Synthes, Westchester, Pennsylvania, USA) for the grafting of non-unions <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Following the operative opening of this cavity, via the greater trochanter, suction tubing and 50&#x000a0;ml bladder syringe was used to collect the sample. In some patients with fracture non-union 10&#x000a0;ml of peripheral blood (PB) was also collected (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5). Samples were transferred immediately into EDTA containing vacutainers (BD Biosciences) and transported to the laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Specimen processing</title><p>Samples were processed under aseptic conditions and sample volumes in millilitres were recorded. The average sample volume for long bone fatty bone marrow aspirate was 12&#x000a0;ml (range 11&#x02013;17&#x000a0;ml); ICBM aspirate volume was always 10&#x000a0;ml. A manual nucleated cell (NC) count was performed on every sample following red cell lysis in 4% acetic acid (Sigma, Gillingham, UK). In some experiments (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4), the aspirated IM contents were left at room temperature for 1&#x000a0;h, during which the fatty contents congealed leading to the formation of &#x02018;solid&#x02019; and &#x02018;liquid&#x02019; phases. To physically separate these phases, samples were passed through a 70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m cell strainer (BD Biosciences). The resulting solid phase was digested using collagenase (Stem Cell Technologies, Grenoble, France) at 1:1 ratio w/v (final concentration&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.125%), for 60&#x000a0;min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

These data confirmed a possibility of using flow cytometry for enumerating MSCs in other marrow sources, including LBFBM aspirates.</p><p>The analysis of different hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types in ICBM and LBFBM aspirates was first performed to compare their basic cellular composition (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The cellularity (both as total NC and MNC counts) of LBFBM aspirates was similar to donor-matched ICBM aspirates (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;1</xref>A and B). The majority of cells in both tissues were CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes, including CD19<sup>+</sup> B-cells, CD33<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells and CD61<sup>+</sup> megakariocytes/platelets (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;1</xref>C and D). Similar to other cell types, the numbers of cells with pro-healing capabilities: CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and CD31+ endothelial/angiogenic cells <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> were not statistically different between the two sources (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;1</xref>C and D).</p><p>Resident MSCs were measured using CFU-F assay and flow cytometry for the CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> cell population (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;1</xref>E&#x02013;I). The frequency of CD45<sup>low</sup> CD271<sup>+</sup> cells was higher in LBFBM aspirate (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E). In correspondence, LBFBM aspirate contained higher numbers of CFU-Fs compared to ICBMA (median values 293 and 115&#x000a0;CFU-F/ml, respectively), however differences narrowly failed to reach statistical significance (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0515, <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>F). CFU-F dishes from a representative donor are shown on <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>G. A similar trend for the MSC increase in LBFBMA was observed following the measurements of CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> cells/ml (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>H). Flow cytometry data from a representative donor are shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>I. It is noteworthy, that no CFU-Fs/MSCs were found in PB of patients with fracture non-unions (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5). Based on these findings it is evident that LBFBM aspirates were not inferior to ICBMA in terms of the proportions of regenerative cells and MSCs per sample volume.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Extended phenotypic characterisation of uncultured MSCs in LBFBM aspirates</title><p>Although MSCs were found in similar proportions in LBFBM and ICBM aspirates, their functional and phenotypic characteristics could be altered in fatty environments. An extended phenotypic analysis of CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> &#x02018;ex vivo&#x02019; MSCs in LBFBM and ICBM aspirates was undertaken to identify any potential differences in surface receptor expression. The gating strategy for this analysis is shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A. CD73 (5&#x02032; Ecto-nucleotidase) is a broadly-accepted MSC marker <xref rid="bb0005 bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[1,39]</xref> and it was expressed at similar levels on CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> &#x02018;ex vivo&#x02019; MSCs from both sources (~&#x000a0;91%, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B).

Finally, we investigated the expression of CD34 molecule on MSCs from ICBMA and LBFBM. This was based on recently-published evidence of CD34 being present on MSCs from lipoaspirates <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Consistent with our previous findings relating to ICBMA <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, CD34 was absent on CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup> CD271<sup>+</sup> MSCs from both bone sources (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B). Overall, MSC marker expression levels were similar in LBFBM and ICBM aspirates and representative marker histograms are shown on <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>C. Therefore, based on the expression of 5 selected surface markers, CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup> CD271<sup>+</sup> cells from LBFBM aspirates had classical &#x02018;ex vivo&#x02019; BM MSC phenotype, similar to ICBMA and different from lipoaspirates.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Phenotypic characterisation of MSC cultures generated from LBFBM and ICBM aspirates</title><p>Although MSC numbers and phenotypes were similar in ICBM and LBFBM aspirates, functional differences in MSCs could exist, due to their anatomical locations.

Early-passage cultures (P3) from both sources had indistinguishable morphology (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>B) and similar phenotypes, using an extended panel of 10 surface markers (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>C). The majority of cultured cells expressed MSC markers CD73, CD90 and CD105 and were negative for hematopoietic lineage cell markers as well as CD31 and CD34. Representative histograms are shown on <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>D. Altogether these data showed that LBFBM aspirates were similar to donor-matched ICBM aspirates in terms of growth and phenotypic characteristics of resident MSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Differentiation potentials of MSCs derived from LBFBM and ICBM aspirates</title><p>To investigate tripotentiality, P3-MSC cultures derived from ICBM and LBFBM aspirates were placed in osteo-, adipo- and chondrogenic differentiation conditions (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4 donors)(<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). All cultures exposed to osteogenic induction conditions for 14&#x000a0;days contained polygonal cells consistent with osteoblastic progression (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A). No obvious pattern of differences between ICBM and LBFBM aspirates was documented in the proportions of alkaline-phosphatase positive cells (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B). Similar data were obtained for adipogenesis: all MSCs were able to produce Oil-Red positive mature adipocytes, with no apparent gross differences between the samples (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;4</xref>C and D). Chondrogenesis was performed using a classical pellet culture <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and measured as accumulation of cartilage-specific proteoglycans per cell <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Similarly to osteo- and adipogenesis, no significant differences between ICBM- and LBFBM-derived pellets were found (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;4</xref>E&#x02013;G).</p><p>We next investigated whether any observed donor-to-donor differences could be attributed to the &#x0201c;in vitro age&#x0201d; of tested cultures (measured as total PDs at P3, i.e. prior to differentiation). On average, MSCs from ICBM aspirates and LBFBM aspirates have both undergone 16PDs, with no apparent correlations being found between the &#x0201c;in vitro age&#x0201d; and functional outcomes for individual cultures. Overall, all these functional data showed that LBFBM MSCs were osteogenic and chondrogenic at the levels comparable, and often superior, to ICBM MSCs, making them suitable for therapeutic bone repair applications.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Enhanced release of MSCs from LBFBM aspirates using an enzymatic digestion technique</title><p>Following 1-hour storage at RT, fatty components of LBFBM aspirates tend to congeal, resulting in the formation of fatty solid aggregates.

Similar findings were observed for percentages of CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;5</xref>C and D). Fatty solid aggregates contributed to ~&#x000a0;23% of total sample volume (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>E) and contained the equivalent of ~&#x000a0;30% of the total sample's CFU-Fs (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>F). At room temperature these MSCs are &#x0201c;trapped&#x0201d; in the solid fatty aggregate, but were easily released by a brief enzymatic digestion.

MSCs are commonly harvested from long-bones in rat <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, mouse <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, rabbit <xref rid="bb0105 bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[21,23]</xref> and porcine <xref rid="bb0120 bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[24,25]</xref> models. In contrast to human subjects, the description of a yellow fatty appearance of the long bone marrow in these reports is rarely mentioned, which may be partly due to the fact that the majority of animal models are sacrificed at a juvenile stage &#x02014; possibly prior to red marrow conversion. The aim of this study was to comprehensively assess human LBFBM as a source of MSCs for bone repair applications and to compare it with ICBM aspirate.</p><p>Using donor-matched samples, we have found that LBFBM was non-inferior to ICBMA in terms of its cellularity, basic cellular composition and the proportions of MSCs. In fact, LBFBM had higher proportions of CFU-Fs compared to ICBMA (2.5-fold). These differences narrowly failed to reach statistical significance but in a larger scale study they may do so. Despite the fatty environment within LBFBM cavity, LBFBM-derived MSCs possessed the classical MSC phenotype, before and after culture, arguing for good preservation of their undifferentiated status. Furthermore, LBFBM-derived MSCs had similar growth characteristics and multipotential properties as their ICBMA counterparts. This is of interest as MSCs from other adipogenic sources have often been shown to be inferior to ICBMA in forming bone <xref rid="bb0060 bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[12,13]</xref> and this may be related to the intra-osseous location of MSCs in long-bone cavities.</p><p>Numerous literature reports describing the presence of CFU-F/MSCs in connective adipose tissues, including lipoaspirates, document MSC frequencies that are considerably higher than in BM aspirates (at least 2 orders of magnitude) (reviewed in <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>). In comparison, the abundance of MSCs in &#x0201c;yellow&#x0201d; fatty marrow aspirates observed in our study appears to be relatively minor (only a 2&#x02013;5 fold higher than in classical &#x0201c;red&#x0201d; marrow aspirates). Given the unique function of adipocytes in the marrow <xref rid="bb0225 bb0230 bb0235" ref-type="bibr">[45&#x02013;47]</xref> and the different metabolic functions of fat in different depot sites <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, our data indicate that the MSC pool size in &#x0201c;fatty tissues&#x0201d; is clearly site-specific. Variations in MSC function have been documented for different types of bone: orofacial, axial and appendicular <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and different depots of fat: arm, flank, thigh and abdomen <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The heterogeneity of MSCs resident within seemingly the same type of tissues but located in different anatomical areas may be explained by varying local demands for tissue turnover and mechanical loads <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Additionally, the MSC topography in diverse human tissues has been described as primarily perivascular <xref rid="bb0250 bb0255" ref-type="bibr">[50,51]</xref> and it is possible that the lower MSC frequency in fatty marrow as opposed to subcutaneous fat may be also related to blood vessel density as suggested previously for human synovium <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and equine adipose tissue <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p>The fact that LBFBM-derived cultured MSCs were able to effectively differentiate towards osteoblasts and chondrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> provided strong evidence that minimally expanded LBFBM-derived MSCs can be used as cell therapy for fracture non-unions. Furthermore, high numbers of CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> cells present in LBFBM samples (up to 67,000, median 43,620 in 10&#x000a0;ml) suggested that their direct injection, in a one-stage procedure, may be possible without prior cell-culture. One previous study has showed that a dose of 50,000 uncultured MSCs from ~&#x000a0;300&#x000a0;ml of ICBMA was efficacious following injection into non-union fracture sites <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A lower volume of LBFBM would therefore be sufficient to obtain a similar number of MSCs. Uncultured MSCs could be effectively concentrated using magnetic beads against the CD271 molecule, based on our findings showing that the proportions of CD45<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup> CD271<sup>+</sup> cells closely reflected that of CFU-Fs <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>The findings from this study also offer an additional cellular mechanism to explain the efficient bone healing process following LB fracture. They show, for the first time, that the marrow contents of long bones contain large numbers of functionally-competent local MSCs. Given a novel concept of local MSC recruitment to fracture sites <xref rid="bb0270 bb0275" ref-type="bibr">[54,55]</xref> and our findings showing large numbers of MSCs in LBFBM in humans, our data point towards a potentially major contribution of locally-recruited LBFBM MSCs to healing of long bone fractures. Systemic MSC circulation in healthy humans and in response to injury remains poorly understood <xref rid="bb0280 bb0285 bb0290 bb0295 bb0300" ref-type="bibr">[56&#x02013;60]</xref>, and in this respect our findings showing no circulating MSCs in patients with fracture non-union (despite high MSC numbers in ICBM and LBFBM) are noteworthy. To the best of our knowledge, the enumeration and the &#x02018;ex vivo&#x02019; phenotype of MSCs in LBFBM in comparison to donor-matched ICBMA have never been reported before. Furthermore, we showed that the marrow contents of long bones contained normal amounts of other cells with regenerative potential (CD34<sup>+</sup> and CD31<sup>+</sup> cells <xref rid="bb0305 bb0310" ref-type="bibr">[61,62]</xref>) necessary to orchestrate the fracture healing processes.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that the femoral IM cavity represents a depot of MSCs which could be used for autogenous/allogeneic use and can be harvested using &#x02018;low-tech&#x02019; techniques for a variety of commonly performed operations including trauma surgery and total hip replacement. The IM cavities of long-bones, in which the FBM resides, are also readily accessible by the orthopaedic surgeon during lower-limb arthroplasty/nailing of long-bone fractures, with the marrow contents requiring removal prior to prosthesis insertion. Enumeration of MSCs from LBFBM is possible using the CD271<sup>+</sup> CD45<sup>low</sup> phenotype and their concentration could be achieved with the use of magnetic beads against the CD271 molecule. The use of freshly-isolated or minimally-expanded LBFBM-derived MSCs could therefore have important scientific and economic benefits in tissue engineering and treatment of fracture non-unions.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
