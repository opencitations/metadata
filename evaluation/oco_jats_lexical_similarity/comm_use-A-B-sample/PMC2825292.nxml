All groups were treated with isoflurane anesthesia three times a week for 2&#x000a0;weeks (approximately 7&#x000a0;min/day). During each anaesthetic period, the right tibiae/fibulae in the DYNAMIC&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;STATIC group were subjected to a peak dynamic load of 11.5&#x000a0;N (40 cycles with 10-s intervals between cycles) superimposed upon a static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d; of 2.0&#x000a0;N. This total load of 13.5&#x000a0;N engendered peak longitudinal strains of approximately 1400 microstrain on the medial surface of the tibia at a middle/proximal site. The right tibiae/fibulae in the STATIC group received the static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d; alone while the NOLOAD group received no artificial loading. After 2&#x000a0;weeks, the animals were sacrificed and both tibiae, fibulae, femora, ulnae and radii analyzed by three-dimensional high-resolution (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) micro-computed tomography (&#x003bc;CT). In the DYNAMIC&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;STATIC group, the proximal trabecular percent bone volume and cortical bone volume at the proximal and middle levels of the right tibiae as well as the cortical bone volume at the middle level of the right fibulae were markedly greater than the left. In contrast, the left bones in the DYNAMIC&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;STATIC group showed no differences compared to the left or right bones in the NOLOAD or STATIC group. These &#x003bc;CT data were confirmed by two-dimensional examination of fluorochrome labels in bone sections which showed the predominantly woven nature of the new bone formed in the loaded bones. We conclude that the adaptive response in both cortical and trabecular regions of bones subjected to short periods of dynamic loading, even when this response is sufficiently vigorous to stimulate woven bone formation, is confined to the loaded bones and does not involve changes in other bones that are adjacent, contra-lateral or remote to them.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mechanical loading</kwd><kwd>Functional adaptation</kwd><kwd>Local regulation</kwd><kwd>Physiological strains</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p>Edited by: David Burr</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since Frost's introduction of the concept of the &#x0201c;mechanostat&#x0201d; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, it has been accepted that bone mass and architecture are regulated in response to the local strains engendered in their tissue by functional loading. This mechanism has been the subject of a number of <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in animals in which artificial loads have been applied to the bones on one side and the modelling and remodelling responses in the loaded bones compared with those in the non-loaded contra-lateral pair <xref rid="bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[2&#x02013;29]</xref>. For this approach to be valid, it is necessary to be sure that the adaptive response of the loaded bones is confined to those bones and does not influence their contra-lateral controls. This assumption has been challenged by the work of Sample et al. <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> who recently reported that in rapidly growing male rats a single period of dynamic high-magnitude axial loading of the ulna on one side was associated with significant levels of new cortical bone formation at the periosteal surface of the contra-lateral non-loaded ulna and in the cortical regions of adjacent bones in the loaded limbs. These responses were prevented by neuronal blockade. The authors <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> inferred from this that mechanically adaptive bone (re)modelling is controlled by processes with substantial systemic and central nervous components. If this inference were true, the focus of research into the mechanisms of mechanically adaptive bone (re)modelling would need to shift away from local responses and toward systemic and central regulation.</p><p>Although their inference did not accord with our experience <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, we could find no published studies specifically directed to establishing that the (re)modelling of bones contra-lateral to those which had been loaded was not different from that in bones in comparable animals where no bones had received artificial loading. Since use of the contra-lateral non-loaded limb as a control has become accepted practice, we undertook the present study to assess whether this was indeed the case. C57BL/6 mice are extensively used as the background of genetically modified animals in the field of bone research, and therefore we used the C57BL/6 mouse unilateral tibia/fibula axial loading model <xref rid="bib12 bib27 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[12,27,29]</xref>. This model has the advantage over the ulna loading model <xref rid="bib2 bib8 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[2,8,30]</xref> of enabling the study of trabecular as well as cortical bone compartments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Virgin, female C57BL/6 mice at 8&#x000a0;weeks of age were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc.

Body weight was measured once a week until sacrifice at 21&#x000a0;weeks of age.

In the NOLOAD group, neither left nor right tibiae/fibulae received any artificial load. In the STATIC group, the right tibia/fibula received a small (2.0&#x000a0;N) static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d; whose primary purpose is to hold the bone in the cups during loading. In the DYNAMIC&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;STATIC group, a larger (11.5&#x000a0;N) dynamic load was superimposed upon the 2.0-N static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d;. Except for these differences in the loading regimen, all three groups received the same treatment. This included isoflurane-induced anesthesia for three alternate days a week for 2&#x000a0;weeks (approximately 7&#x000a0;min/day) during which loading took place. Normal cage activity was allowed between the treatments. High doses of calcein (50&#x000a0;mg/kg; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and alizarin (50&#x000a0;mg/kg; Sigma Chemical Co.) were injected intraperitoneally on the first and last days of the treatments (days 1 and 12), respectively. At 21&#x000a0;weeks of age (day 15), the mice were euthanized and their tibiae, fibulae, femora, ulnae and radii were collected for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo external mechanical loading</title><p>The apparatus and protocol for dynamically loading the mouse tibia/fibula have been reported previously <xref rid="bib12 bib13 bib27 bib29 bib32" ref-type="bibr">[12,13,27,29,32]</xref>. In brief, the flexed knee and ankle joints are positioned in concave cups; the upper cup, into which the knee is positioned, is attached to the actuator arm of a servo-hydraulic loading machine (Model HC10; Zwick Testing Machines Ltd., Leominster, UK) and the lower cup to a dynamic load cell. The tibia/fibula is held in place by a low level of continuous static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d;, onto which is superimposed higher levels of intermittent &#x0201c;dynamic&#x0201d; load.</p><p>In the present study, 2.0&#x000a0;N was used as the static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d; which was held for 400&#x000a0;s according to the original protocol <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The 11.5&#x000a0;N of &#x0201c;dynamic&#x0201d; load was superimposed onto the 2.0-N static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d; in a series of 40 trapezoidal-shaped pulses (0.025&#x000a0;s loading, 0.050&#x000a0;s hold at 13.5&#x000a0;N and 0.025&#x000a0;s unloading) with a 10-s rest interval between each pulse. Strain gauges attached to the medial surface of the tibial shaft of similar 19-week-old female C57BL/6 mice showed that at a proximal/middle site (37% of the bone's length from its proximal end) a peak load of 13.5&#x000a0;N engendered approximately 1400 microstrain <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Although a peak load of 12.0&#x000a0;N can induce significant osteogenic responses in both cortical and trabecular bone <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, we selected a higher peak load (13.5&#x000a0;N) which was sufficient to induce woven bone formation in the loaded tibia <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Woven bone is generally seen in areas where the strain-related stimulus is high. Sample et al. <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> reported that it was at the &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; level of peak load that dynamic loading of the ulna resulted in (re)modelling responses in other bones that were not loaded.

The data presented support the validity of the assumption, in the C57BL/6 mouse unilateral tibia/fibula axial loading model <xref rid="bib12 bib27 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[12,27,29]</xref> at least, since they showed no difference in bone (re)modelling between the bones of appropriately matched mice in which no bones were loaded and those contra-lateral to bones which had received static or static plus dynamic loading. From this we draw the narrow inference that bones in the contra-lateral limbs to those loaded at physiological levels sufficient to stimulate a vigorous osteogenic response can be used as non-loaded controls. We also draw the wider inference that functionally adaptive control of bone architecture is a local phenomenon within each bone that does not involve adjacent, regional or contra-lateral bones. The lack of uniformity in response in different regions of the loaded tibia suggests that the domain in which local strains influence (re)modelling is not only confined to the loaded bone but also is regional within it. While we have no reason to believe that this inference does not have general applicability, prudence dictates that it should be verified in each experimental situation where it is employed.</p><p>Our present experiment was not designed to establish the potential involvement of the nervous system in bones' functionally adaptive response. In the earliest experiments using artificial loading, Hert et al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> showed that adaptation took place in the tibia when the sciatic nerve had been sectioned. This accords with our experience <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Functional adaptation to loading has also been shown not to be affected by pharmacological blockade of the sympathetic nervous system <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These findings give us no reason to suggest that it is necessary to invoke nervous control in order to explain bones' functionally adaptive control of bone (re)modelling.</p><p>It was also not our intention to reproduce the experimental conditions in Sample et al.'s <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> study nor to explore experimentally the inconsistencies between their data and ours. There are a number of ways in which loading of one bone can have substantial effects on (re)modelling of adjacent and remote bones that are independent of normal, strain-related functionally adaptive (re)modelling. For example, new bone formation may be stimulated by the effects of trauma or interference with blood supply or be associated with the repair processes which any follow these events. We have no way of assessing whether these may have contributed to the responses reported by Sample et al. The animals they used were rapidly growing male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats and young growing bone is more sensitive to such effects. The loading regimen they employed in the ulna was a severe one based on one of our earlier protocols <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> (3750 microstrain; 1500 cycles at 4&#x000a0;Hz [a total of 375&#x000a0;s]). In contrast, the loading regimens we use in the tibia/fibula as well as ulna to assess strain-related adaptation (less than 2000 microstrain; 40 cycles at 10&#x000a0;Hz with 10-s intervals between each cycle [a total of 400&#x000a0;s]) <xref rid="bib12 bib13 bib27 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[12,13,27,29]</xref> are designed to produce a realistic physiological stimulus capable of stimulating a measurable osteogenic response while avoiding collateral stimulation associated with trauma and interference with blood supply both within the bone and around the loading cups. We select to use &#x0201c;three-dimensional&#x0201d; high-resolution (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) &#x003bc;CT rather than &#x0201c;two-dimensional&#x0201d; fluorescent histomorphometry as our main tool to quantify functional adaptation in order to be able to analyze precisely comparative sites of the small mouse loaded and contra-lateral non-loaded bones. In our present study, when we employed the same histomorphometric analysis as Sample et al. <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, it revealed no substantial differences from the &#x003bc;CT data and thus confirmed the absence of any differences in (re)modelling between non-loaded bones regardless of whether they were contra-lateral to bones which had been loaded or to those which had not.</p><p>Our inference that strain-related functional adaptation in bone is a local phenomenon that does not extend to other bones or involve systemic or nervous intervention is limited to strains within the physiological range. Strains higher than this, or those repeated far more often, or perhaps with faster strain rates may well induce damage in the bone tissue and/or damage-related changes in the bone cells. In this situation, it is quite possible that the responses to these events may spread beyond the bones actually loaded and incorporate systemic involvement and/or involvement of the nervous system. Indeed, Sample et al. <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> observed no or less systemic and contra-lateral (re)modelling responses when they employed lower strains (760 and 2000 microstrains). The immediate experimental implication of this is that it would be prudent in any study that relies on use of contra-lateral non-loaded bones as controls to establish the level of loading-related stimulation that does not exceed the level necessary to stimulate local, strain-related functional adaptation. More intensive strain regimens may engender effects that extend beyond the local confines of the loaded bones. The wider implication may be that there is a distinction between the mechanisms involved in strain-related functional adaptation, the (re)modelling of which leads to adaptive changes in bone architecture presumably to regulate functional strains and the trauma-related (re)modelling which involves wider responses.</p><p>In the present study, a static load of 2.0&#x000a0;N did not affect cortical bone of the right loaded tibiae/fibulae or their longitudinal lengths. However, the right loaded proximal tibiae in the STATIC group had decreased trabecular thickness at the site 0.01&#x02013;0.25&#x000a0;mm distal to the growth plate compared to the same site in the left proximal tibiae in the NOLOAD group. Since short periods of a higher level of static load can suppress bone formation <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, the current static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d; of 2.0&#x000a0;N we used should be reduced in future studies nearer to the static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d; of 0.2&#x000a0;N employed by Fritton et al. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, the data presented here, obtained from skeletally mature female C57BL/6 mice, suggest that the (re)modelling response of bones subject to short periods of artificial loading that engenders physiological strains is confined to the bones that are loaded. There is no reason to believe that this is a unique feature of these mice or the specifics of the tibia/fibula axial loading model <xref rid="bib12 bib27 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[12,27,29]</xref>. The narrow implication of these findings is that since loading of one bone at physiological levels does not influence (re)modelling in bones that are contra-lateral, adjacent or remote to the bones that are loaded, the contra-lateral bones can be used as non-loaded controls. However, this should be established for each experimental model. The wider implication of this finding is that the mechanisms for physiological, strain-related, functional adaptation can legitimately be examined as local phenomena. In contrast, it is clear that, when the intensity of a strain regimen increases, the responses to it may extend to include a far wider spectrum of influences.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>H.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bone &#x0201c;mass&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;mechanostat&#x0201d;: a proposal</article-title><source>Anat.
