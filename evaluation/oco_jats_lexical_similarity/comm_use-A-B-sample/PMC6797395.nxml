The MIST2 study demonstrated that intrapleural administration of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and DNase, or t-PA alone increased the volume of drained PF. Mouse model studies have suggested that the volume increase is due to the interaction of the pleura with the t-PA via the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) pathway. We designed a study to determine the time frame of drained PF volume induction on intrapleural delivery of t-PA&#x000b1;DNase in humans, and to test the hypothesis that the induction is mediated by the MCP-1 pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data and samples from the MIST2 study were used (210 PI patients randomised to receive for 3 days either: t-PA and DNase, t-PA and placebo, DNase and placebo or double placebo).

PI is an age-old clinical problem, which was accurately described by Hippocrates (460&#x02013;370 BC) and has been responsible for numerous deaths ever since. Every year PI affects 80&#x02009;000 patients in the UK and the USA and there is evidence suggesting that the incidence of the disease is increasing in both adult and paediatric populations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> Standard medical treatment of PI relies on appropriate antibiotic administration, drainage of the infected pleural fluid (PF) and nutritional support.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances over recent years, PI remains a severe illness associated with poor clinical outcome and high morbidity and mortality. Approximately 20% of PI patients require surgery as a rescue treatment when antibiotic administration and PF drainage through a chest tube fail and the disease progresses.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> The 1-year mortality rate for the general population of PI patients is around 20%, whereas for aged and frail patients, it is above 30%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Hospitalisation rates have doubled and the median length of hospitalisation ranges between 12 and 15&#x02009;days, with 25% of patients remaining in hospital for more than 1&#x02009;month.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;11</xref> As a result, PI is associated with a heavy socioeconomic burden with the related healthcare cost estimated at US$5000 per patient.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>As the disease progresses, intrapleural levels of fibrinolysis inhibitors, including tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), rise leading to the arrest of fibrinolytic activity and consequently to the intrapleural accumulation of fibrin.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> The development of pleural fibrinous septations partitions the pleural space into several locules that prevent drainage of PF and thus increase the risk of requirement for surgery as rescue treatment. The intrapleural administration of fibrinolytics has been advocated as a treatment that cleaves fibrin, and therefore, improves chest-tube drainage and reduces the need for surgery. Notably, human and animal data suggest that intrapleural delivery of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) stimulates an increase in PF output.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref></p><p>The MIST2 randomised clinical trial (RCT) tested the effect of intrapleural administration of t-PA to cleave septations, and DNase to reduce viscosity of PF due to extracellular DNA.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The results demonstrated that intrapleural delivery of t-PA and DNase, or t-PA alone increased the volume of drained PF, and t-PA DNase was associated with reduced length of hospital stay and need for surgical referral at 3&#x02009;months.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, the time frame of the intrapleural drug activity remains unknown, and identification of the intrapleural t-PA&#x000b1;DNase activity period is essential to improve patient management. Moreover, the molecular pathways by which fibrinolytics promote increased PF output and facilitate the drainage of pleural space are unclear.</p><p>Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), also known as chemokine ligand 2 (CCL-2), is a chemokine that has been associated with inflammation, endothelial permeability, malignant pleural effusion and pleural injury repair mechanisms.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> A study, based on mouse in vivo and human in vitro data, suggested that PF volume induction is due to the interaction of the pleura with t-PA via the MCP-1 pathway.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Lansley <italic>et al</italic> reported that the inhibition of MCP-1 activity decreased the volume of PF induction on intrapleural delivery of t-PA. Data from a clinical trial suggested a benefit for PI patients that received pleural saline irrigation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These two studies in combination suggest that the stimulation of pleural effusion formation (&#x02018;pleural weep&#x02019;) caused by intrapleural t-PA delivery may trigger a therapeutic lavage that enables clearance of the pleural cavity. However, the MCP-1 hypothesis has not been confirmed in human PI patients.</p><p>We designed and conducted a study with the aim to identify the time frame of intrapleural t-PA&#x000b1;DNase activity and to assess the hypothesis that MCP-1 pathway mediates the drained PF volume induction in human PI patients following intrapleural delivery of t-PA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Samples</title><p>For the present study, we used the PF samples of the MIST2 RCT.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> PF samples were taken at randomisation and daily thereafter (where available), processed with sodium citrate and stored in &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C freezers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PF drainage records</title><p>For the purposes of the MIST2 study, PF drainage was recorded daily and used to determine the activity period of intrapleural t-PA&#x000b1;DNase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Patients</title><p>Two hundred and twenty PI patients provided written consent to participate into the MIST2 study and were randomly assigned to receive intrapleurally for 3&#x02009;days either: t-PA and DNase, t-PA and placebo, DNase and placebo or double placebo.

The MIST2 study demonstrated that intrapleural administration of t-PA and DNase in PI patients improved PF drainage and reduced surgical referral rate. A mouse PI model suggested that the intrapleural delivery of t-PA induces the levels of MCP-1, which subsequently promotes the formation of PF. We designed and conducted the first study to assess the MCP-1 hypothesis in humans. We measured the MCP-1 PF levels of MIST2 samples and examined the probable correlation between protein levels and volume of the PF output. Our data suggest that MCP-1 is likely to be associated with the formation process of excess PF, but is unlikely to be the sole mechanism of action.</p><p>The comparison of the volume of drained PF between the periods of treatment and post-treatment revealed that intrapleural delivery of t-PA&#x000b1;DNase increases PF volume drained solely during the treatment period. During the post-treatment period, no statistical differences in PF volume were observed between groups. The effect of t-PA&#x000b1;DNase&#x02009;was observed only during the period of drug delivery. Following t-PA&#x000b1;DNase treatment, the volume of PF output decreased and reached a level close to the non-t-PA treated patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, whereas during the treatment period, there was a statistically significant increment in PF MCP-1 levels for patients who received t-PA&#x000b1;DNase compared with enrolment (baseline), no differences were detected when compared with the non t-PA (placebo&#x000b1;DNase) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). Moreover, protein levels of MCP-1 were not correlated to volume of drained PF.</p><p>This study has limitations regarding the stability of the proteins after a long-term freeze period. The number of freeze-thaw cycles affects stability of the MCP-1 recombinant protein.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This may be an issue for native MCP-1 stability in our samples, thus, we used samples that have not been thawed in the past.</p><p>The trend in MCP-1 PF levels suggests that the MCP-1 pathway partially affects the induction of excess PF, however, it is likely that there are more key molecular pathways involved. A high-throughput protein profiling assay study is now needed to identify the molecular pathways that drive PF formation following intrapleural delivery of t-PA.
