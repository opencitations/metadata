Main outcomes were the proportion of participants, over 12 months, who were still self-monitoring, had not experienced adverse events, and had achieved &#x0003e;80% of time in therapeutic range (TTR).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 296 participants were recruited; their median age was 61 years and 55.1% were male. Participants were predominately professional or held a university qualification (82.7%). At 12 months, 267 (90.2%) were still self-monitoring. Mean TTR was 75.3% (standard deviation 16.9).Six serious and two minor adverse events were reported by GPs. Only 45.9% of participants received any in-person training at the outset. Increased age (<italic>P</italic> = 0.027), general wellbeing (EQ-5D visual score, <italic>P</italic> = 0.020), and lower target international normalised range (INR, <italic>P</italic> = 0.032) were all associated with high (&#x0003e;80% TTR) levels of control.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings show that, even with little training, people on OAT can successfully self-monitor, and even self-manage, their INR. TTR was shown to improve with age. However, widespread use of self-monitoring of INR may be limited by the initial costs, as well as a lack of training and support at the outset.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anticoagulants</kwd><kwd>primary care</kwd><kwd>monitoring</kwd><kwd>self-management</kwd><kwd>self-monitoring</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) substantially reduces thromboembolic events with no increase in major haemorrhagic events.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, uptake is still affected by the need to maintain the international normalised ratio (INR) in a narrow range, which requires frequent testing and dose adjustment. Reliable and accurate point-of-care devices enable patients to test their INR in their own setting. They can either self-monitor their INR and have their oral anticoagulation dosage managed by a healthcare provider or they can self-manage and adjust their own dosage.</p><p>Patients have been found to vary considerably in their ability to self-monitor and self-manage. Results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) show that only 38% (range 12&#x02013;59%) of those initially identified as potentially eligible for self-monitoring of OAT actually participated in the trials; in addition, only 78% assigned to the intervention continued self-monitoring until the end of the trial.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Current guidelines recommend self-monitoring or self-management for patients who have long-term indications, a recognised target INR, and have received appropriate training by a health professional.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The outcomes of the trials for those that participate fully have been positive for both self-monitoring and self-managing OAT,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> but it is not known whether these results translate into routine practice.

During the study period, this distributor had 99.9% of the market share.</p><p>All people aged &#x02265;18 years, who were able to give informed consent, comprehend English sufficiently well to be interviewed, and registered with a UK GP were eligible to take part. Recruitment lasted from February 2009 until August 2011. Originally, only those who were new to self-monitoring &#x02014; defined as self-monitoring for &#x02264;3 months &#x02014; were recruited. However, due to low numbers, recruitment was broadened to include people who had been self-monitoring for some time and were purchasing replacement devices.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) greatly reduces thromboembolic events without increasing major haemorrhagic events. The outcomes of a number of trials have been positive for both self-monitoring and self-managing oral anticoagulation, but it is not known whether these results translate into routine practice. This study shows that, even without much training, individuals on OAT can self-monitor, and even self-manage, their international normalised ratio (INR) with positive results outside of trial settings. Such patients could be offered self-monitoring and self-management of their OAT with suitable healthcare support. However, it should be noted that participants in this study were highly educated so caution should be taken with regard to generalising the findings to the broader population.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>As the primary aim of the study was to obtain an adequate estimate of the rate of successful self-monitoring, the sample size calculation was based on a certain precision around this estimate (equal to 1.96 standard errors, or one side of a 95% confidence interval [CI]). The worse-case scenario in terms of precision, given a rate of 50% (maximum variance) and a 20% attrition, would require 300 participants to achieve a precision of &#x000b1;6% around the estimate (for example, 95% CI = 44 to 56). A rate of 35% (or 65%) based on the same sample would give a precision of &#x000b1;5.4%. Rates of &#x0003c;35% (or &#x0003e;65%) would give better precision levels. This sample also allows for the identification of predictive variables with odds of greater than approximately 2.5 &#x02014; for example, an odds ratio [OR] of 2.3 for an event of 70% in the successful group, versus 50% in the unsuccessful group &#x02014; with similar confidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline telephone interviews and questionnaires</title><p>Consenting participants were sent a postal questionnaire and telephoned to complete a baseline interview.

Participant INR data was excluded if the submitted test results spanned &#x0003c;90 days in total during the study period. TTR was not interpolated for the missing periods. Data with a reported gap between tests of &#x0003e;12 weeks was treated as intermittent.</p><p>Forward stepwise logistic regression was used to establish potential predictors of successful self-monitoring. Only baseline characteristics were included in the model; the addition of whether a participant had experienced a surgical procedure during the 12 months was excepted as this was likely to reduce TTR. Age, sex, condition requiring oral anticoagulation, duration of self-monitoring, surgical procedure during follow-up, and previous oral anticoagulation complications were all entered into a model before the addition of baseline variables with a univariate OR <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.10.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the individuals approached to participate in the study, 299 were eligible, completed the baselines questionnaires, and were recruited.

Increased age, OAT for atrial fibrillation or thrombosis, and having a higher score on the EQ-5D visual scale were all associated with success. When the participants with antiphospholipid syndrome were removed from the model only increased age and EQ-5D visual scale and lower target INR range were associated with success.</p><p>Of concern is that less than one-half the participants had received in-person training (46%) and, when it was present, this lasted, on average, for &#x0003c;1 hour. Instead, individuals appeared to rely solely on the training information that came with their device when it was purchased. Anticoagulation services varied in the support offered to patients wishing to self-monitor. Some had established systems, including training schemes, in place. In other areas, particularly those in which local GP surgeries were commissioned to provide anticoagulation services for their patients, approval to self-monitor was done on a more ad hoc basis without any dedicated schemes set up. Moreover, only 15% of those new to self-monitoring who were adjusting their own dosage of anticoagulation therapy had received in-person training when they commenced self-monitoring.</p><p>This cohort comprised well-educated, professional people, who successfully managed their self-monitoring with relatively little training; they also had a high level of knowledge about oral anticoagulation which was not related to training. Participants were aware of quality assurance and nearly two-thirds had performed an external calibration check of their device over the 12 months. In addition, they were similar to the general population in terms of anxiety and depression. A small number of participants could not commence self-monitoring or dropped out due to lack of healthcare provider support.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge this is the first prospective cohort study of people self-monitoring their INR outside of trial conditions; the modified study design allowed for comparisons between those new to self-monitoring and those who had been self-monitoring for some time.</p><p>A limitation of the study is that, due to the fact that self-monitoring INR devices are expensive (approximately &#x000a3;400 in the UK), the participants were those people who were well educated and able to afford the device. This is of concern as the results may, therefore, not be generalisable to the wider population and current provision may be widening inequalities in health care.</p><p>Another potential limitation is the fact that the study, in part, relied on participants&#x02019; self-reported INR results. However, the accuracy of these have been confirmed in a small sample in which the reported results were compared to those stored in the memory of their monitor.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>The majority of participants were still self-monitoring at 12 months, with a level of control higher than that achieved by the majority of participants in other RCTs.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> These results are consistent with the findings of a large retrospective study<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> of patient self-testing, which showed a high level of control in males (76%TTR), females (71%TTR), and older patients (&#x0003e;74 years, &#x0003e;73% TTR). In addition, the low number of adverse events compares favourably with rates for those in the intervention arms of the RCTs (7.5%).<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>This study reliably shows that participants can effectively self-monitor their own INR, but current provision is limited due to the initial costs of the device and the lack of healthcare provider support.</p><p>Even with little training, people on OAT can successfully self-monitor and self-manage their INR; however, the fact that one-third of the participants gave different target INR ranges from the ones provided by their GP at the end of this study suggests that closer monitoring by healthcare providers may be warranted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Eve Knight, co-founder and chief executive of AntiCoagulation Europe (ACE); Christian Schaefer, president of International Self-Monitoring Association of Oral Anticoagulated Patients (ISMAAP); Bob Vause, patient participation representative and members of the advisory committee; and Sally Tyndel for early work on the study.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) Programme (reference number: PB-PG-0408-15191) and by the NIHR National School for Primary Care Research.
