Rocker-sole shoes are inherently unstable and may serve as an effective balance training device. This study hypothesised that wearing rocker-sole shoes would result in long-term improvement in barefoot postural stability in people with CLBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>20 participants with CLBP were randomised to wear rocker-sole or flat-sole shoes for a minimum of 2&#x02005;hours each day. Participants were assessed barefoot and shod, over three 40&#x02005;s trials, under 4 posture challenging standing conditions. The primary outcome was postural stability assessed by root mean squared error of centre of pressure (CoP) displacement (CoP<sub>RMSE AP</sub>) and mean CoP velocity (CoP<sub>VELAP</sub>), both in the anteroposterior direction, using force plates. Participants' were assessed without knowledge of group allocation at baseline, 6&#x02005;weeks and 6&#x02005;months (main outcome point). Analyses were by intention-to-treat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At 6&#x02005;months, data from 11 of 13 (84.6%) of the rocker-sole and 5 of 7 (71.4%) of the flat-sole group were available for analysis. At baseline, there was a mean increase in CoP<sub>RMSE AP</sub> (6.41 (2.97) mm, p&#x0003c;0.01) and CoP<sub>VELAP</sub> (4.10 (2.97) mm, p&#x0003c;0.01) in the rocker-sole group when shod compared with barefoot; there was no difference in the flat-sole group. There were no within-group or between-group differences in change in CoP parameters at any time point compared with baseline (1) for any barefoot standing condition (2) when assessed shod eyes-open on firm ground.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although wearing rocker-sole shoes results in greater postural instability than flat-sole shoes, long-term use of rocker-sole shoes did not appear to influence postural stability in people with CLBP.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Biomechanics</kwd><kwd>Exercise rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Lumbar spine</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>What are the new findings?</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Standing in a rocker-sole shoe reduced postural stability compared with standing barefoot, whereas standing in a flat-sole shoe did not influence postural stability.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Long-term use of rocker-sole or flat-sole shoes do not influence postural stability in barefoot standing.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study questions the belief that balance rehabilitation, especially when delivered in standing using rocker-sole shoes, will result in a long-term influence on postural control in people with chronic low back pain (CLBP).

The results were concordant with Hypothesis 1; that is, that the wearing of rocker-sole shoes provides a less stable surface to stand on than flat-sole shoes. However, the results do not support Hypothesis 2; there were no differences in barefoot CoP parameters within-groups or between-groups during barefoot trials at 6&#x02005;weeks or 6&#x02005;months, compared with baseline, for any standing condition. Furthermore, there were no changes from baseline in CoP parameters in the rocker-sole group when shod at 6&#x02005;weeks and 6&#x02005;months. These findings suggest that adaptation of the postural control system did not occur following long-term wear of rocker-sole shoes. Alternatively, the outcomes assessed were not appropriate to detect any potential training effect offered by the rocker-shoes.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Anteroposterior CoP parameters</title><p>The current study demonstrated similar barefoot baseline CoP parameters between shoe groups.

However, neither group demonstrated a significant change in CoP parameters at any follow-up compared with baseline when barefoot or shod. This lack of change suggests that the rocker-sole footwear either (1) provided an additional postural challenge; however, the type of challenge did not result in long-term improvements in sensorimotor function, (2) provided an appropriate postural challenge but &#x02018;dosage&#x02019; was insufficient for a training effect to occur or (3) influenced proprioceptive deficits; however, improvements were not detected.</p><p>The first explanation, suggesting that the increased postural challenge from rocker-sole shoes does not influence long-term improvements in sensorimotor function compared with wearing flat-sole shoes, concurs with the findings of other studies.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>

When compared with standing barefoot, the rocker shoes demonstrated a 57&#x02013;146% increase in the CoP parameters assessed. Introducing additional postural challenge in an attempt to increase the CoP parameters further may not only be unsafe or impractical in a CLBP population, but may also, in the absence of evidence to support a relationship between increased postural challenge and change in CoP parameters or clinical change, be inappropriate.</p><p>The third explanation suggests that the null hypothesis was incorrectly accepted and study conclusions are incorrect. This may have been due to an underpowered sample, poor reliability of the outcome variables or an insensitivity to detect genuine changes in postural control. The reliability of the outcome variables may be improved by increasing the duration and number of trials. However, of the numerous CoP parameters regularly reported in research assessing postural stability, the two parameters chosen in the current study have been reported as highly reliable.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Although changes in CoP parameters have been suggested as appropriate outcome measures to detect clinical change,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> to the authors knowledge, measurements of the SE of CoP parameters, during challenging standing conditions, have yet to be reported in the literature for people with CLBP. The differences in postural instability outcomes during challenging standing conditions for both shoes types in the current study are less than the reported SEs of the same CoP parameters assessed in reliability studies investigating elderly participants (who also demonstrate poor postural stability).<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Changes in CoP parameters following an intervention may be too small to reliably determine whether change in postural stability has occurred.</p><p>The clinical study investigating the effects of rocker-sole footwear on CLBP,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> from which the current participants were recruited, demonstrated clinically important statistically significant reductions in disability and pain (in rocker-sole and flat-sole shoe groups) at follow-up; however, the current study demonstrates no change in postural parameters.

If the latter, the use of any mechanical indices as outcome measures would be inappropriate; if the former, alternative mechanical outcome measures need to be developed and tested.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations</title><p>A systematic review investigating acceptable reliability for CoP parameters in asymptomatic individuals, published subsequently to the start of the current study, recommended a minimum trial duration of 90&#x02005;s&#x02014;a greater duration than that applied in this clinical trial.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, in the current study, prolonged standing may have aggravated symptoms, and negatively influenced attrition rates.</p><p>The authors recognise the small sample size of this study may have resulted in a type II error.
