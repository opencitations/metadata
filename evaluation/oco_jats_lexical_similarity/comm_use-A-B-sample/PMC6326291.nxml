MPM can be complicated by the presence of tumour on the visceral pleura preventing the lung from re-expanding, known as trapped lung (TL). There is currently no consensus on the best way to manage TL. One approach is insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) under local anaesthesia. Another is video-assisted thoracoscopic partial pleurectomy/decortication (VAT-PD). Performed under general anaesthesia, VAT-PD permits surgical removal of the rind of tumour from the visceral pleura thereby allowing the lung to fully re-expand.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>MesoTRAP is a feasibility study that includes a pilot multicentre, randomised controlled clinical trial comparing VAT-PD with IPC in patients with TL and pleural effusion due to MPM. The primary objective is to measure the SD of visual analogue scale scores for dyspnoea following randomisation and examine the patterns of change over time in each treatment group. Secondary objectives include documenting survival and adverse events, estimating the incidence and prevalence of TL in patients with MPM, examining completion of alternative forms of data capture for economic evaluation and determining the ability to randomise 38 patients in 18 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study was approved by the East of England-Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee and the Health Research Authority (reference number 16/EE/0370).

Although the import and use of asbestos has been banned in over 60 countries worldwide, including the UK, MPM remains a major clinical and public health problem.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</p><p>MPM caused 2542 deaths in the UK in 2015, and globally, mesothelioma is estimated to cause 38 400 deaths per year.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Epidemiological data indicate that 65 000 deaths are expected between 2002 and 2050 in the UK alone.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Currently, median survival is around 9.5 months, there is no known cure and treatment is palliative.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Only Pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy have been shown to offer a significant benefit providing a modest survival increase of 8&#x02013;10 weeks.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p><p>One of the most debilitating symptoms for patients with MPM is breathlessness caused by the build-up of fluid in the pleural space. As the pleural effusion increases, symptoms become more severe, and patients are often referred for drainage and a talc pleurodesis, with a view to preventing recurrence.</p><p>An effective pleurodesis is dependent on apposition of visceral and parietal pleura. In mesothelioma, it is common for tumour to be present on the visceral surface of the lung. This can prevent the lung from fully reinflating following fluid removal, meaning that the visceral and parietal pleura cannot appose. This situation is called &#x02018;trapped lung&#x02019; (TL).</p><p>When the lung is trapped, the fluid recurs leading to repetitive cycles of breathlessness, drainage and fluid reaccumulation. This leads to repeated hospital attendances with associated healthcare costs as well as distress and inconvenience to the patient and their families. Furthermore, the pleural space can become loculated such that subsequent aspirations/drains are less effective, and the risk of pleural infection is increased with subsequent morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Rather than repeated pleural aspirations/drains, some clinicians are now using an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) to manage TL. Inserted under local anaesthesia as a day case procedure, an IPC is a soft silicone catheter with a one-way valve at the distal end. Generally well tolerated, it can drain fluid for weeks to months. Spontaneous pleurodesis is thought to develop in around 20% of cases, allowing the IPC to be removed.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> However, complications such as pleural infection (&#x0003c;5%), blockage (20%) or displacement can occur requiring removal or replacement, and for some, the presence of the catheter acts as a constant reminder of the underlying disease.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Placement of an IPC may also be dependent on availability of a community-based healthcare professional to drain fluid 2&#x02013;3 times weekly if the patient cannot manage this independently.</p><p>An alternative approach often favoured by thoracic surgeons is video-assisted thoracoscopic partial pleurectomy/decortication (VAT-PD).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Performed under general anaesthesia, VAT-PD permits surgical removal of the rind of tumour from the visceral pleura, thereby allowing the lung to fully expand again. Simultaneous removal of mesothelioma from the parietal pleura allows pleurodesis to occur. The advantage of this approach is that TL and pleurodesis are treated in one procedure, but disadvantages include the requirement for general anaesthesia, an inpatient stay of up to 7 days and a postoperative serious adverse event (SAE) rate of 17%.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and the Cochrane Library for articles about the management of TL by IPC and VAT-PD in patients with mesothelioma using the keywords &#x02018;mesothelioma&#x02019;, &#x02018;entrap* lung*&#x02019;, &#x02018;encase* lung*&#x02019; or &#x02018;restrictive pleuris*&#x02018; or &#x02018;unexpand* lung*'.</p><p>The prevalence of TL in MPM is poorly documented. In case series of malignant pleural effusion with TL, the underlying aetiology was MPM in 13%&#x02013;37% of cases.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref>
</p><p>No randomised trials comparing IPC with VAT-PD for management of TL in MPM (or other lung malignancy) have been reported. However, several small, retrospective mixed tumour type series reporting IPC use in TL indicate that IPCs may be safe, reasonably effective at controlling dyspnoea and that their use could reduce repeated admissions to hospital.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref>
</p><p>With regard to VAT-PD, there are no published studies specifically addressing the management of TL in MPM. However, the 2011 European Respiratory Society/European Society of Thoracic Surgery (ERS/ESTS) MPM guidelines recommended that pleurectomy/decortication is considered for symptomatic patients with TL (recommendation grade 2C) and that a VATS approach is preferred (grade 1C).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> There is also little research examining the understanding of surgical treatments for MPM or exploring factors influencing willingness to participate in MPM trials or decisions regarding randomisation.</p><p>The MesoVATS trial randomised patients with MPM to talc pleurodesis versus VAT-partial pleurectomy.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Although there was no difference in median survival between the two arms, there was some evidence that surviving patients in the VAT arm had better quality of life from 6 months post-treatment than surviving patients in the talc pleurodesis arm. However, because of the inclusion criteria, there were very few cases of TL in MesoVATS, and therefore, the outcomes are not directly applicable to MPM with TL and pleural effusion. Searches on ClinicalTrials.gov show there are no ongoing studies examining IPC versus VAT-PD for TL in MPM.</p><p>The rationale for undertaking the MesoTRAP study is to begin to provide high-quality evidence for the best management of TL, which affects a significant percentage of patients with MPM in their final months of life. TL is a challenging condition to manage and is associated with high morbidity; therefore, a study investigating the two most commonly used approaches, namely IPC and VAT-PD, is timely.</p><p>The objectives of this study are to determine whether it is possible to identify, recruit and randomise patients to a trial of insertion of an IPC versus VAT-PD in TL due to MPM and then, following randomisation, to measure dyspnoea and chest pain using visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, assess post-treatment complications, measure resource and health service use and monitor quality of life in each treatment group.</p><p>If the pilot clinical trial is successful in recruiting and randomising 38 patients in the 18-month timeline and there is no evidence of patient harm from study interventions (when comparing one randomised group with the other), we plan to develop the trial into a full phase III study to compare the efficacy of IPC versus VAT-PD for managing TL with pleural effusion in MPM.</p><p>There has been one Substantial Amendment to the study protocol to date as described below:</p><p>Pilot clinical trial:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Removal of the exclusion criterion &#x02018;IPC in situ for more than 28 days&#x02019;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Removal of the exclusion criterion &#x02018;Previous attempt at pleurodesis on ipsilateral side&#x02019;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in wording of inclusion criterion from &#x02018;Confirmed MPM&#x02019; to &#x02018;Pathologically confirmed MPM&#x02019;.</p></list-item></list><p>Overall feasibility study</p><p>1.

Although Teare <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>recommends larger sample sizes on the basis that, over all trial phases, they are more efficient than inflating the SD based on confidence limits, a much larger study is not feasible within a reasonable time frame.

MesoTRAP has been designed to begin a comparison of these two options in terms of patient benefit. Patients will only be randomised if their clinician is confident that they are suitable for both IPC and VAT-PD. At present, we do not know what the difference in patient benefit is between the two interventions.</p><p>Investigators at all sites agree to adhere to study-specific standard operating procedures for performing VAT-PD and IPC procedures.</p><sec id="s3-6-1"><title>Video-assisted thoracoscopic partial pleurectomy/decortication</title><p>Under general anaesthesia, a thoracic surgeon creates an initial port in the chest wall and the pleural effusion is drained to dryness. Additional ports are optional to achieve lung expansion. Thoracotomy (with rib spreading) is prohibited. Sharp and blunt dissection of the visceral pleura is mandatory to release TL. A parietal pleurectomy is optional by developing an extrapleural plane. This dissection plane is extended as widely as possible. Resection of the diaphragmatic and pericardial pleura are optional but not generally performed. At the end of the procedure, one or more intercostal drains are placed, with the use of suction optional. The median length of stay for VAT-PD was 7 days (IQR 5&#x02013;11 days) in MesoVATS.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

The proximal part is inserted into the pleural space, and the distal valve is connected to a vacuum drainage bottle. The IPC can be drained at home by the patient, carer or district nurse as often as required.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Criteria for modifying or discontinuing allocated intervention</title><p>If a patient, randomised to VAT-PD deteriorates to the point that they are not fit enough to undergo VAT-PD, they will be offered an IPC instead. This decision will be at the discretion of the clinical team managing the patient and will be recorded and reported. For patients randomised to the IPC arm, the IPC may be removed if there is no significant drainage for 4 weeks and no radiological evidence of significant fluid reaccumulation. All recruited patients will be reported.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Data collection</title><p>Detailed screening logs will be collected from sites on a monthly basis, and these will be used to assess the prevalence of TL.</p><p>Patients will be followed up according to the visit schedule (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Clinical and health resource use data will be collected at baseline, and the patient will be asked to complete two quality of life questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQC30) along with VAS scores for chest pain and dyspnoea. Patients will be given paper diaries to record their VAS score for chest pain and dyspnoea daily for 6 weeks, then weekly up to 12 months. Measurements of the VAS scores will be taken according to an agreed standard operating procedure with duplicate measurements being taken at the coordinating centre. Patients who are randomised to IPC will be given a paper diary to record their fluid drainage from randomisation to study completion.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Schedule of events</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Specific activity</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Screening</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline/<break/>randomisation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention<break/>(0&#x02013;3 weeks postrandomisation)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 weeks&#x000b1;1 week</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 months&#x000b1;1<break/>week</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 months&#x000b1;1 weeks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 months&#x000b1;1 weeks</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Check eligibility of potential participant</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
