Ascorbic acid is an enzymatic co-factor necessary for the synthesis of collagen and the proliferation of fibroblasts and has been proposed as a coadjuvant to strengthen the healing effects of honey.

Wound healing (scar tissue formation) is a process involving three phases: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. It results from a series of interactions between cytokines, growth factors, blood components, and cell elements, which promote the production of components of the basal membrane, prevent dehydration, and increase inflammation and the formation of granulation tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Burns are oxidative injuries, which increase the activity of free radicals in the damaged area, resulting in an increase in lipid peroxidation. According to clinical studies, early application of honey to burns has proven effective since it acts on free radicals, which validates its use on lesions of this kind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, treatment with honey has presented significantly faster healing of burns than treatment with silver sulfadiazine, polyurethane film, and amniotic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and autolytic debridement activity of honey has also been validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Honey consists of water, sugars (especially glucose and fructose), antioxidants, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, glucose oxidase, and gluconic acid, which gives rise to honey&#x02019;s acidity (pH&#x000a0;3.2 to 4.5). The medical properties of honey depend on its chemical composition, which varies principally as a function of the plant from which it is derived. This has led to the development of various products based on monofloral honeys, for example, the therapeutic Medihoney&#x02122; and Active Manuka Honey&#x000ae;, both made from the pollen of the Manuka tree (Europe). The establishment of a controlled designation of origin gives value-added honey. In Chile, Ulmo (<italic>Eucryphia cordifolia</italic>)&#x000a0;honey has been shown to possess excellent bactericidal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and healing properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The stimulant effect of honey is due not only to its sugar content but to other constituents that act in synergy. Thus, the reduction in healing time may be the result of a double effect. On the one hand, prolonged inflammatory response is reduced by suppression of the production and propagation of inflammatory cells at the wound site; on the other, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is stimulated, resulting in a proliferation of fibroblasts and epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The stress associated with a burn lesion increases the need for ascorbic acid,&#x000a0;which is required for collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and as an antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], as has been extensively studied in guinea pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Horton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] examined the effects of the treatment based on the administration of vitamins after burn trauma, showing the effects on the synthesis of cardiomyocytes and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. He also indicated that the combination of antioxidants (vitamins C, E, and A) could provide useful support to the healing effect.</p><p>Given the complexity of treating burns and the need for experimental studies offering similar or better alternatives to conventional treatments, the aim of this work was to carry out a histological and morphometric study of the effect of Ulmo honey supplemented with ascorbic acid on the healing and contraction of burn wounds and compare this effect with that of unsupplemented Ulmo honey.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physical and chemical properties of honey</title><p>Samples of Ulmo honey were harvested on March 2014 from various apiaries in the Valdivian forest of southern Chile. The honeys were stored at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and homogenized with a stirrer before measurement. The Ulmo honey was sterilized by gamma irradiation at 25&#x000a0;kGy. The pollen was identified by melissopalynology using light microscopy analysis as per NCh2981 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The levels of sporulating aerobic mesophilic microorganisms, anaerobic sulfite-reducing microorganisms, molds, and yeasts in irradiated Ulmo honey were determined by Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Microbial counts were expressed as colony-forming units per gram (cfu/g)&#x000a0;of honey. The mixture (Ulmoplus) was prepared using Ulmo honey supplemented with a solution of ascorbic acid. The physical and chemical properties of Ulmo honey and supplemented Ulmo honey were determined as follows: the viscosity was measured with a double cylinder digital high-speed viscometer (digital viscometer, model MRC, VIS-79 series; MRC, Israel) at 20&#x000b1;2 &#x000b0;C. To determine the pH, 5&#x000a0;g of homogenized honey was mixed with 20&#x000a0;mL of distilled water and the pH of the samples was measured using a digital pH meter. Samples of honey were analyzed for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content according to the spectrophotometric method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Five grams of honey was dissolved in 25&#x000a0;mL of water, transferred quantitatively into a 50-mL volumetric flask; 0.5&#x000a0;mL of Carrez solution I and 0.5&#x000a0;mL of Carrez II were added and the volume was made up to 50&#x000a0;mL with water. The solution was filtered through paper, and the first 10&#x000a0;mL of the filtrate were rejected. Aliquots of 5&#x000a0;mL were put into two test tubes: one tube was added with 5&#x000a0;mL of distilled water (sample solution) and the second was added with 5&#x000a0;mL of sodium bisulfite solution 0.2&#x000a0;% (reference solution). The absorbance of the solutions at 284 and 336&#x000a0;nm was determined using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Genesys 6, Thermo Scientific, USA). The quantitative HMF value was calculated according to the following equation:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The animals were divided at random into three groups: positive control (C+), Ulmo&#x000a0;honey only (H), and supplemented honey (SH) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Two test guinea pigs were also used to obtain a biopsy of the healthy skin to assess normality. A uniform deep burn of the back skin was performed with a hot metal object (1000&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) during an exposure for 3&#x000a0;s. A biopsy of the burned area was extracted. The extracted region was a circular area of 1&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>. Intraperitoneal anesthesia was applied with a mixture of ketamine (40&#x000a0;mg/kg), xylazine (5&#x000a0;mg/kg), and atropine (0.05&#x000a0;mg/kg). The burns were treated by the application of tepid physiological serum by syringe at a distance of 10&#x000a0;cm from the lesion; gauze impregnated with unsupplemented Ulmo honey was applied to the H group, Ulmo honey supplemented with ascorbic acid to the SH group, and hydrogel-tull to the C+ group. The animals were treated with this procedure, and the wounds were evaluated daily until biopsies were taken at day 10 post-injury. Day 10 post-treatment was selected because that day was representative of the proliferative phase of wound healing on research done previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Among these properties are low pH and high sugar content. It has been reported that low pH values inhibit the presence and growth of microorganisms. Honeys are acidic due to the presence of organic acids that contribute to their flavor and stability against microbial spoilage. The pH values obtained for the H and SH groups were lower than the results reported for Moroccan honeys (3.55 to 4.28), Indian honeys (3.7 to 4.4), Algerian honeys (3.70 to 4.00), and Malaysian honeys (3.83 to 4.10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. If honey is sterilized by gamma irradiation, it is to be expected that a small, restricted variety of microbes will be found in the honey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The results obtained are consistent with the above and agree with the findings of Finola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. They are much lower than those reported by Iurlina and Fritz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], where the numbers of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, molds, and yeasts were less than 103&#x000a0;cfu/g for all samples analyzed. Both Ulmo honey and supplemented Ulmo honey could be used as potential antibacterial agents.</p><p>HMF content is widely known to be an indicator of honey freshness and high temperature processing. Both samples (Ulmo honey and supplemented Ulmo honey) presented an HMF level lower than the limit (40&#x000a0;mg/kg). These results suggested that the samples were fresh and had not been heat processed.</p><p>Wound healing involves the substitution of damaged tissues. Burn wounds suffer tissue destruction, which heals by the synthesis of fibrous tissue and tissue contraction. The latter implies great mechanical and physiological effort responsible for tissue retraction, depending on collagen synthesis and compaction of the granulation tissue. This supports the concept that the wound contraction mechanism occurs through locomotion rather than cell contraction forces and that the collagen is compacted by fibroblasts and not myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Human keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cell responses are positively affected in the presence of honey; thus, honey may accelerate re-epithelization and wound closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. According to Khoo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], Tualang honey produced better wound contraction results in vivo than conventional medicine. In our study, the value of GCI in the H group was high (0.875&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.158) and was similar to the C+ (0.883&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.159), whereas it was much higher in the SH group (1.115&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.188). Osuagwu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] stated that the contraction force in the wound is located in the granulation tissue, describing greater formation of granular tissue in wounds treated with honey than in the control group. We found that the DPA was better in the H group (426,739.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;509) than in the C+ group (339,660.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;350). The area was larger than both of these in the SH group (684,774.359&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;459), in which the healing action of honey was strengthened. The GHI index presented higher values in the SH group (0.963&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.22) than in the C+ (0.829&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.253) and H groups (0.671&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.252). The large difference between the values for the groups treated with supplemented and unsupplemented honey is striking; the effect of Ulmo honey is seen to be boosted by supplementing with ascorbic acid.</p><p>Honey may be considered an effective option for autolytic debridement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It induces activation of the cells of the immune system, promoting wound debridement and so accelerating the repair process. The debriding action generated by the different treatments was evaluated clinically, observing an autolytic action&#x000a0;in all groups. It was determined that the earlier the eschar came off, the faster the debriding action. Thus, the H and SH groups in the experiment presented excellent debridement, higher than the C+ group.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness is an important factor in treatment selection. According to clinical study by Moghazy et al., treatment with honey has shown a short healing interval, with a mean of 2.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.94&#x000a0;weeks, while the duration with other treatments is considerably longer (17.7&#x000a0;weeks with conventional dressings, 15.7 with hyperbaric oxygen, and 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks with laser therapy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The high index of wound contraction and healing obtained with the proposed treatment indicates that treatment with honey supplemented with ascorbic acid would be shorter than with honey alone or conventional dressings (synthetic hydrogel-tull). Our conclusions agree with Adewumi and Ogunjinmi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which given its cost-effectiveness, the incorporation of this alternative into health plans for burns and chronic wounds is indispensable, particularly in rural areas.</p><p>Guinea pigs were used as animal models because, unlike other mammals, their metabolism is dependent on ascorbic acid. The guinea pig is also an excellent model for healing studies since its skin thickness remains constant once its body weight exceeds 450&#x000a0;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Honey supplemented with ascorbic acid may be an ideal substance for use in treatment as it is easy to apply and remove. Its low cost and absence of risk of antimicrobial resistance are the main arguments in favor of the application of this product for treating wounds compared to unsupplemented honey or the positive control. It was confirmed that the treatment in this study achieved effective, rapid, good quality healing. It was shown that supplementing the Ulmo honey with ascorbic acid boosted the healing and contraction effects on burn wounds compared to unsupplemented honey. These results are proof of the synergy between honey and ascorbic acid in healing burn wounds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>C+, positive control; DCI, deep contraction index of the wound; DN, diastase number; DPA, dermal proliferation area; GCI, global contraction index; GHI, global healing index; H, experimental group with unsupplemented honey; HMF, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural; SCI, superficial contraction index of the wound; SH, experimental group with supplemented honey; WSI, wound severity index.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The present study was funded by the DIUFRO DI13-0044 and CORFO R+D 13IDL2-23290 Projects.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The data from the present study cannot be shared yet, because they are part of the CORFO R+D Project 13IDL2-23290 and research is ongoing.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CSCH organized and supervised the experimental design, execution, and derivation of data for statistical analysis.
