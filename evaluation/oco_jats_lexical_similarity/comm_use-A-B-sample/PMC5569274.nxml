</p><p>Inflammation contributes to fibrosis<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and causes pain that may impair skeletal muscle function.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, it has been common practice to reduce inflammation with drugs, such as COX-2 inhibitors.

Stage I was a crossover with a washout phase of 21 days between phases; stage II was continued as parallel group comparison.

Administration of medication began 72&#x02009;hours before an exhaustive eccentric exercise day and continued for 72&#x02009;hours following the muscle damaging exercise. Each subject completed an activity diary and a food frequency questionnaire. The clinical trial complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local health authority and ethical committee.

Nutritional status was assessed via questionnaire at screening; subjects were asked not to change nutritional habits; and standardised meals were offered during the exercise day. Subjects were not to practise any physical activity (including driving to work by bicycle) during the study. All physical activities were documented. Subjects were also instructed to avoid activities after the exercise such as massages or hot bathing or showering. Relevant exclusion criteria were history or presence of any medical disorder, intake of anti-inflammatory medication, food supplements or use of other procedures directly affecting muscle function or performance within 4 weeks prior to or during trial. Intake of analgesic medication or consumption of alcohol was not allowed 24&#x02009;hours prior and until 72&#x02009;hours after exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size</title><p>Non-parametric sample size calculation within the framework of a multiple outcome approach<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;33</xref> was performed applying the validated software Nnpar V.1.0 (IDV, Gauting, Germany).

Stage II data were evaluated separately due to significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>&#x0003e;0.5) and, in contrast to stage I, did not result in differences of SET or placebo on EIMD. Biomarkers responded to SET across both study stages.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The trial was carefully planned using a multidimensional approach for outcome assessment and classification, taking into account the multidimensional aspect of recovery from EIMD. Additionally, a two-stage approach with interim analysis and continuation with refined hypotheses and readjusted sample size offered all opportunities to finalise the trial successfully.</p><p>Surprisingly, the preplanned test for carryover effects was statistically significant on the defined level &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> (p=0.0092, one&#x000a0;sided, Wei-Lachin procedure, Bauer-K&#x000f6;hne &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>=0.0102) in stage I. Thus, according to statistical plan, only phase 1 data from stage I could be used for non-parametric confirmatory analysis, and the crossover approach had to be abandoned in stage II in favour of a parallel group comparison. One possible explanation for carryover effects is that impairment of muscle function could have been influenced by recent, that&#x000a0;is, within some months,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> high-force eccentric work using the same muscle(s).

The duration of weekly strength training was reported at nearly three times for stage II compared with stage I (179 vs 61&#x02009;min). Further, overall training duration across all disciplines was higher in stage II than stage I (482 vs 369&#x02009;min). Therefore, stage II participants were more well&#x000a0;trained than stage I participants, particularly related to strength (resistance) exercises. This may increase PTM by higher physical performance and by increase in pain threshold or the ability to increase PTM despite pain. Insensitivity of the study model to detect advantages of SET might have been caused by these differences in baseline resistance training. It has been suggested to report individual data and to classify subjects, for&#x000a0;example, low, medium/moderate or high responders, to allow for a better presentation and interpretation of the data.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49 51</xref>
