Lowering [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> paradoxically enhances ADP-evoked aggregation, an effect that has been attributed to enhanced thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> production. This study examined the role of ectonucleotidases in the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependence of platelet activation. Reducing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> from millimolar to micromolar levels converted ADP (10 &#x003bc;mol/l)-evoked platelet aggregation from a transient to a sustained response in both platelet-rich plasma and washed suspensions. Blocking thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> production with aspirin had no effect on this [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependence. Prevention of ADP degradation abolished the differences between low and physiological [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> resulting in a robust and sustained aggregation in both conditions. Measurements of extracellular ADP revealed reduced degradation in both plasma and apyrase-containing saline at micromolar compared to millimolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. As reported previously, thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> generation was enhanced at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, however this was independent of ectonucleotidase activity<sub>.</sub> P2Y receptor antagonists cangrelor and MRS2179 demonstrated the necessity of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors for sustained ADP-evoked aggregation, with a minor role for P2Y<sub>1</sub>.

P2Y<sub>1</sub> is coupled to G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>, leading to an increase in cytosolic calcium through stimulation of phospholipase C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> (PLC<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Jin <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Savi <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Leon <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>), whereas P2Y<sub>12</sub> is coupled to G<sub>&#x003b1;i</sub>, leading to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3-K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Trumel <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Jackson <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. For platelet-platelet adhesion, and thus thrombus formation, activation of the fibrinogen receptor &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> is required, a process that depends upon concomitant stimulation of G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub> and G<sub>&#x003b1;i</sub> signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Jin &#x00026; Kunapuli, 1998</xref>). Several platelet agonists bind to receptors coupled to G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>, including thrombin, thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TXA<sub>2</sub>) and ADP. However, ADP is the only platelet agonist that stimulates G<sub>&#x003b1;i</sub> signalling at physiological concentrations and is therefore an essential co-stimulus to achieve full functional responses for all known platelet agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dorsam &#x00026; Kunapuli, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gachet, 2008</xref>). Despite the central role of ADP in platelet aggregation and thrombogenesis, it is normally considered to be a weak platelet agonist due to the reversible nature of the aggregation response observed <italic>in vitro</italic> at physiological levels of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gachet, 2008</xref>). Extremely low levels of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> abolish fibrinogen binding to &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin, however at micromolar extracellular calcium concentrations, ADP-evoked aggregation is enhanced compared to physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and not readily reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mustard <italic>et al</italic>, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Packham <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>). Although this paradoxical effect was reported more than two decades ago, the underlying basis whereby extracellular calcium modulates ADP-evoked aggregation remains unclear. It has been proposed that millimolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels inhibit TXA<sub>2</sub> generation via altered ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), leading to loss of secondary aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mustard <italic>et al</italic>, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Packham <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>), however exactly how Ca<sup>2+</sup> achieves this effect is not known.</p><p>Following stimulation of platelet P2Y receptors with ADP, the duration and amplitude of the response can be regulated by two principal mechanisms, firstly, desensitization of the P2Y receptors preventing further signalling and, secondly, removal of ADP by ectonucleotidases. Ectonucleotidases comprise a large family of extracellular nucleotide degrading enzymes including ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPDases), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (E-NPPs), alkaline phosphatases and 5&#x02032; nucleotidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Zimmermann, 2000</xref>). ADP derived from platelets and other blood cells is thought to predominantly be metabolised by E-NTPDase1 (CD39), a membrane-bound enzyme expressed by endothelial cells, lymphocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kansas <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Marcus <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>), as well as microparticles that originate from these cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Atkinson <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Banz <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). CD39 converts ADP to AMP, which is subsequently converted to adenosine, an inhibitor of platelet function, by 5&#x02032; nucleotidase (CD73) expressed on endothelial cells and in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Coade &#x00026; Pearson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Zimmermann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Heptinstall <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). There is also evidence that soluble E-NPPases in plasma can degrade ADP directly to adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Birk <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Cauwenberghs <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), thus ectonucleotidases can convert prothrombotic mediators into inhibitors of platelet activation.</p><p>In this study we have investigated further the mechanism(s) underlying the differential responses to ADP at physiological compared to low (micromolar) extracellular calcium concentrations. We demonstrate that degradation of ADP by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ectonucleotidases is an important factor in determining the amplitude and duration of platelet aggregation. The results have consequences for understanding the effectiveness of ADP as a platelet agonist, and in the selection of experimental conditions to explore P2Y receptor activation.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>CHRONO-LUME was purchased from Labmedics (Manchester, UK), Pyruvate kinase was obtained from Roche Diagnostics Limited (East Sussex, UK), GF109203X and MRS2179 were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK).

In platelets resuspended in a physiological saline with apyrase, 10 &#x003bc;mol/l ADP evoked a transient aggregation response in the presence of 2 mmol/l [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, which was also converted to a sustained response by omission of CaCl<sub>2</sub> from the saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1C, E</xref>; transmission levels 2 min after ADP of 0&#x000b7;6 &#x000b1; 2% and 53&#x000b7;2 &#x000b1; 5&#x000b7;4%, respectively), in agreement with reports by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mustard <italic>et al</italic>, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Packham <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>).

These studies concluded that enhanced TXA<sub>2</sub> production accounts for the paradoxical amplifying effect of lowering Ca<sup>2+</sup> on ADP-evoked aggregation. The present study now shows that altered degradation of ADP can also contribute to this phenomenon. The known Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of ecto-ADPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Marcus <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Zimmermann, 2000</xref>) provides the basis for the difference observed in millimolar <italic>versus</italic> micromolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and this conclusion is supported by direct measurements of ADP. The sustained aggregation evoked by ADP is largely due to stimulation of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors, consistent with previous reports of the more crucial role of this G<sub>i</sub>-coupled pathway compared to P2Y<sub>1</sub> in amplifying responses to ADP, collagen and thrombin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Trumel <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dorsam &#x00026; Kunapuli, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hechler <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Jackson <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Cosemans <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The present results also highlight the importance of controlling for nucleotide breakdown in studies of P2 receptor signalling when the external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is modified. For example, it is common practice to include soluble apyrase to limit P2 receptor desensitization within <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and simply to vary the external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to investigate the relative contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry <italic>versus</italic> release pathways in nucleotide-evoked signalling events.</p><p>The limited aggregation response at normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> has contributed to the view that ADP is a &#x02018;weak platelet agonist&#x02019;. However, when metabolism of ADP is limited, the ability of this agonist to stimulate sustained aggregation, as shown in the present study, is more consistent with the substantial reduction in platelet activation observed in P2Y<sub>1</sub> and P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Fabre <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Leon <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Andre <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and the major role of ADP in amplifying collagen- and thrombin-evoked responses <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is possible that dense granule secretion evoked by collagen and thrombin provides a more sustained source of ADP compared to the single bolus application used in standard <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. Furthermore, ATP (and thus also ADP) remains sustained for a considerable time near sites of vascular injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Born &#x00026; Kratzer, 1984</xref>), probably reflecting the continual recruitment and activation of platelets during the haemostatic process. Thus, the <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental condition that limits ADP degradation, such as micromolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, may more closely represent the ability of this agonist to stimulate platelet function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Alternatively, use of a non-hydrolysable analogue, such as ADP&#x003b2;S, or repeated application of ADP to replace degraded agonist should be considered within <italic>in vitro</italic> studies designed to investigate mechanisms of ADP-dependent platelet activation.</p><p>Whilst ADP degradation significantly contributed to the transient nature of the responses to ADP in millimolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, we agree with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Packham <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) that TXA<sub>2</sub> generation is lower at millimolar compared to micromolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. In our experiments, the marked enhancement of TXB<sub>2</sub> generation by lowering [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was also observed in apyrase-free saline, indicating that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of TXA<sub>2</sub> generation can occur independently of effects on ectonucleotidase activity. It has been reported that reduced TXA<sub>2</sub> synthesis in physiological calcium concentrations is the result of inhibited ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), however the process by which this is achieved is unclear, and whether these effects are downstream of an extracellular event or whether calcium influx is required, remains to be investigated. In the present study, 10 &#x003bc;mol/l ADP stimulated sustained aggregation at millimolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> in the absence of apyrase, conditions under which there was no detectable TXA<sub>2</sub> generation, suggesting that this response is independent of secondary signalling through TXA<sub>2</sub> receptors. At lower concentrations of ADP, however, the release of secondary agonists is required to achieve full aggregation, therefore the effect of extracellular calcium on TXA<sub>2</sub> production may be more significant, and modulation of ADP-evoked aggregation by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> may result from a combination of both altered ectonucleotidase activity and TXA<sub>2</sub> production.</p><p>Although we did not observe any difference in aggregation within the normal physiological range of extracellular calcium concentrations (0&#x000b7;5&#x02013;2 mmol/l) (three donors, data not shown), results from this study demonstrate the impact of variable ectonucleotidase activity on platelet function, which may have profound implications in certain clinical conditions. It has previously been reported that in blood from patients with elevated leucocyte counts, degradation of ADP is accelerated and aggregation in response to ADP is reduced due to increased NTPDase levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Pulte <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Glenn <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Moreover, in a rat model of cholestatic liver disease where plasma ectonucleotidase activity is enhanced, reduced aggregation was exhibited in response to ADP and low dose collagen (which is dependent on ADP secretion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Witters <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Conversely, individuals demonstrating reduced ectonucleotidase expression may have more reactive platelets and be more susceptible to thrombotic events. Such patients may benefit from therapeutic intervention with soluble forms of NTPDase1.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study shows that reduced degradation of ADP by ectonucleotidases contributes to the paradoxical amplification of ADP-evoked aggregation at micromolar compared to millimolar extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. The sustained inside-out activation of fibrinogen receptors that occurs in response to ADP at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is likely to be more representative of the potential contribution of ADP to a developing thrombus <italic>in vivo</italic>, where a constant supply of this P2Y receptor agonist from activated platelets can override enzymatic clearance in the vicinity of a developing thrombus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Supported by the British Heart Foundation (PG/05/014 &#x00026; PG/06/017).</p></ack><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare they have no
