Seventeen-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were given daily subcutaneous injections of vehicle (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20) or risedronate at a dose of 0.15, 1.5, 15 or 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10 in each) for 17&#x000a0;days. From the fourth day of treatment, the right tibiae were subjected to a single period of axial loading (40 cycles/day) for three alternate days per week for two weeks. The left tibiae were used as internal controls. Trabecular and cortical sites in the tibiae were analyzed by high-resolution micro-computed tomography and imaging of fluorochrome labels. In the non-loaded tibiae, treatment with the higher doses of risedronate at 15 or 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day resulted in higher trabecular bone volume and trabecular number than in vehicle-treated controls, whereas such treatment was associated with no differences in cortical bone volume at any dose. In the loaded tibiae, loading induced increases in trabecular and cortical bone volume compared with contra-lateral controls primarily through increased trabecular thickness and periosteal expansion, respectively, independently of risedronate treatment. In conclusion, the response to mechanical loading in both trabecular and cortical bone in mice is therefore not impaired by short-term treatment with risedronate, even over a 1000-fold dose range. In considering the optimization of treatments for osteoporosis, it is reassuring that anti-resorptive therapy and mechanical loading can exert independent beneficial effects.</p><p><bold>This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Bisphosphonates.</bold></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Research highlights</title><p>&#x025ba; We assessed the combined effect of a bisphosphonate and loading on bone structure. &#x025ba; Non-invasive tibia loading and a 1000-fold dose range of risedronate were used. &#x025ba; Loading significantly increased both cortical and trabecular bone mass. &#x025ba; Risedronate does not reduce the osteogenic effect of loading.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bisphosphonate</kwd><kwd>Risedronate</kwd><kwd>Mechanical loading</kwd><kwd>Functional adaptation</kwd><kwd>Osteoporosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p>Edited by: David Burr</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bisphosphonates play a central role in the management of osteoporosis <xref rid="bb0005 bb0010 bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[1&#x02013;3]</xref>. Their major mechanism of action is to suppress osteoclast function and survival <xref rid="bb0020 bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>. Due to the normal coupling of bone resorption to formation, one of their effects is to lower bone turnover <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

<xref rid="bb0035 bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[7,8]</xref>. In contrast to the anti-resorptive effects of bisphosphonates, mechanical loading is the predominant functional osteogenic factor responsible for maintaining structurally appropriate levels of bone mass in adults <xref rid="bb0045 bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[9,10]</xref>.</p><p>By suppressing bone resorption, bisphosphonates effectively slow the decline in bone mass due to any cause including decreased mechanical loading <xref rid="bb0055 bb0060 bb0065 bb0070 bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[11&#x02013;15]</xref>. The question remains as to their effect on the (re)modeling associated with a net osteogenic stimulus such as that derived from a therapeutic regimen of exercise. Some pilot clinical reports have shown an additive effect of bisphosphonates and exercise on areal bone mineral density <xref rid="bb0080 bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[16,17]</xref>, but other trials failed to find such an additive effect <xref rid="bb0090 bb0095 bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[18&#x02013;20]</xref>. In experiments involving treadmill exercise in ovariectomized rats, the combination of etidronate, alendronate or risedronate treatment with exercise had additive or synergistic effects on bones <xref rid="bb0105 bb0110 bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[21&#x02013;23]</xref>, whereas zoledronic acid and exercise did not show either effect <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Since exercise would induce significant changes in cardio-pulmonary and nervous systems as well as skeletal muscle, the effect of combining bisphosphonates with local mechanical stimulation has been studied in a variety of rodent loading models. Again, however, the results are not consistent <xref rid="bb0125 bb0130 bb0135 bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[25&#x02013;28]</xref>. The effect of clodronate on periosteal apposition was increased when combined with mechanical loading in the rat tibia <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, whereas a recent study suggested that zoledronic acid impaired cortical bone's response to loading in the mouse tibia <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In contrast, alendronate, risedronate and zoledronic acid at clinical doses did not influence periosteal expansion induced by loading in the rat ulna <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Only one study investigated the effect of combining a bisphosphonate with loading in trabecular bone and showed that pamidronate did not change osteogenesis caused by invasive loading in the rat tail <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Among the currently available bisphosphonates with different mineral binding and biochemical actions, risedronate has a comparatively lower affinity for bone mineral <xref rid="bb0145 bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[29,30]</xref>, which may facilitate its access to the mechano-responsive cells of the osteocytic lacunar network <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Importantly, risedronate has a relatively potent action on the appendicular skeleton <xref rid="bb0020 bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[4,32]</xref>. In the present study, we assessed the separate and combined effects of various doses of risedronate with external mechanical loading on trabecular and cortical bone, by using the non-invasive mouse tibia axial loading model <xref rid="bb0165 bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[33,34]</xref>. This approach has the advantage that it allows examination of the effect of local mechanical stimulation, distinct from that of exercise, in both trabecular and cortical bone compartments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Animals</title><p>Virgin, female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Inc.

During this treatment, the right tibiae were subjected to external loading under isoflurane-induced anesthesia for three alternate days per week (approximately 7&#x000a0;min/day) on days 4, 6, 8, 11, 13 and 15. Normal activity within the cages was allowed. The non-loaded contra-lateral (left) bones were used as internal controls, as has previously been validated in the model used in the present study <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and confirmed by others in the rat ulna axial loading model <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

At 19&#x000a0;weeks of age (day 18), the mice were euthanized and their tibiae were collected for analysis. Body weight was measured before (day 1) and after (day 18) these treatments. Although it could have been potentially interesting to use ovariectomised animals <xref rid="bb0180 bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[36,37]</xref>, we chose to simplify the experimental design and to study a full dose response to risedronate in intact animals.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> external mechanical loading</title><p>The apparatus and protocol for non-invasively loading the mouse tibia have been reported previously <xref rid="bb0165 bb0170 bb0185 bb0190 bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[33,34,37&#x02013;39]</xref>. In brief, the flexed knee and ankle joints are positioned in concave cups; the upper cup, into which the knee is positioned, is attached to the actuator arm of a servo-hydraulic loading machine (Model HC10; Zwick Testing Machines Ltd., Leominster, UK) and the lower cup to a dynamic load cell. The tibia is held in place by a low level of continuous static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d;, onto which higher levels of intermittent &#x0201c;dynamic&#x0201d; load are superimposed. In the present study, 0.5&#x000a0;N was used as the static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d; which was held for approximately 7&#x000a0;min. The 11.5&#x000a0;N of &#x0201c;dynamic&#x0201d; load was superimposed onto the 0.5&#x000a0;N static &#x0201c;pre-load&#x0201d; in a series of 40 trapezoidal-shaped pulses (0.025&#x000a0;s loading, 0.050&#x000a0;s hold at 12.0&#x000a0;N and 0.025&#x000a0;s unloading) with a 10&#x000a0;s rest interval between each pulse.

Although the treatment period was short, high doses of risedronate (15 and 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day) resulted in higher trabecular BV/TV and trabecular number.

In contrast, no significant changes in cortical bone volume were detected with risedronate treatment at any dose, while a low dose of risedronate (1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day) resulted in slightly lower periosteally enclosed volume.

Consistent with previous studies <xref rid="bb0170 bb0185 bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[34,37,38]</xref>, mechanical loading produced increases in both trabecular and cortical bone mass in all loaded limbs, primarily by increased trabecular thickness and periosteal expansion, respectively.

There was no synergistic effect of risedronate and loading on either trabecular or cortical bone at any dose. Although the loading-related increase in trabecular thickness was marginally reduced by risedronate at a dose of 15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day, this could be due to lower mechanical strains engendered resulting from the higher trabecular bone mass by the risedronate treatment.</p><p>These results are consistent with previous histomorphometric findings in the rat showing that the osteogenic response to mechanical stimulation is not altered by bisphosphonates <xref rid="bb0130 bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[26,27]</xref>. In the first of these studies <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, the tail vertebrae were invasively loaded in the presence or absence of pamidronate and new bone formation induced by loading in the trabecular region was independent of bisphosphonate treatment. In the second <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, the effect of alendronate, risedronate and zoledronic acid at clinical doses on load-induced cortical modeling in the rat ulna was investigated following ovariectomy and none of these bisphosphonates significantly inhibited periosteal apposition. In contrast, a recent experiment using the mouse tibia suggested that there was a negative interaction between zoledronic acid and mechanical loading in cortical bone <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, this could be associated with lower mechanical strains engendered resulting from the increased cortical bone mass by the zoledronic acid treatment.</p><p>It remains to be determined whether other anabolic therapies besides mechanical loading, when used in conjunction with an anti-resorptive agent, have a negative, additive or synergistic effect on the skeleton. Clinical evidence has shown that there can be a negative interaction between alendronate and intermittent parathyroid hormone, the only anabolic drug currently licensed for osteoporosis treatment <xref rid="bb0235 bb0240" ref-type="bibr">[47,48]</xref>. This interaction seems to be less for risedronate than alendronate <xref rid="bb0245 bb0250" ref-type="bibr">[49,50]</xref>. On the other hand, mechanical loading in rodents has been shown to suppress sclerostin expression in osteocytes <xref rid="bb0195 bb0255" ref-type="bibr">[39,51]</xref>, and sclerostin neutralizing monoclonal antibody also increases bone formation independently of bone resorption in humans as well as rats <xref rid="bb0260 bb0265" ref-type="bibr">[52,53]</xref>. Further elucidation of the osteogenic pathways induced by mechanical loading will therefore offer the potential for developing potent anabolic approaches which can act independently of bone resorption.</p><p>In conclusion, mechanical loading-related increases in both trabecular and cortical bone mass are not reduced by even high doses of risedronate in almost skeletally mature female mice. This experimental evidence suggests that osteogenic exercise can have beneficial effects on bone health independently of those derived from the anti-resorptive effects of bisphosphonates in patients with osteoporosis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
