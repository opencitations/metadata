</p><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cardiac rupture was first described by William Harvey, in 1647, and, in 1967, mitral
valve replacement was referred to in a study of autopsies<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Its incidence and mortality rates are about 1% and
85%, respectively<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The etiology
of rupture is still not well defined<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>PRESENTATION CASE</title><p>We present a case of a 51-year-old female patient who has authorized the publication
of this case preserving her identification. She had heart failure New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class III, electrocardiography (ECG) with atrial flutter.</p><p>Echocardiogram identified a marked dilation of the left atrium (65 mm) with extensive
internal mural thrombosis; double rheumatic mitral lesion with moderate to severe
stenosis (valve area of 1.3 cm<sup>2</sup> by planimetry); thickened aortic valve
with mild regurgitation and global systolic performance of left ventricle (LV)
preserved. Coronary angiography was normal.</p></sec><sec><title>TECHNIQUE AND RESULTS</title><p>Mitral valve replacement surgery was performed on 7/16/2009 through median
sternotomy. The mitral valve had fibrosis with a retraction of both cusps and
calcified areas that progressed toward the posterior annulus of the mitral valve,
hindering the preservation of tissue in this area of risk. The removal of posterior
cusp calcium took the fragility of the posterior ring. A St. Jude 29 mechanical
prosthesis was fitted and the pulmonary veins were isolated by cauterization of the
endocardium, for the reversal of atrial fibrillation. After decannulation,
infiltration of the rear wall by extensive hematoma was observed, and various
bleeding points, characteristic of rupture of the rear wall, possibly due to the
removal of calcium from the posterior ring that seriously weakened the region. As
there was no bleeding yet, just blood infiltration and hemorrhagic diffuse points on
musculature, it was opted for an alternative strategy for bleeding correction: a
flap of bovine pericardium was immediately fixed with N-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate and
methacryloxysulfolane (Glubran<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) over the area of bleeding,
filling the retrocardiac space with absorbable gelatin sponge
(Gelfoam<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) for compression, without the use of sutures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). With these measures and the control of
blood pressure (mean arterial pressure maintained between 50 and 60 mmHg), bleeding
was contained.</p><p>

</p><p>After the operation, the patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) under
stable hemodynamic conditions. Regarding pressure, mean blood pressure between 50
and 60 mmHg was maintained for 72 hours. The haematocrit at the end of the surgery
was 27%, it was 21% at first postoperative day. The patient received two units of
packed red blood cells.</p><p>The total bleeding was 700 ml. There weren't postoperative complications, no
acidosis, the patient was extubated 7 hours after the end of the surgery and she was
discharged on the seventh postoperative day with 29% of haematocrit. After 60 months
of follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic and control echocardiogram shows good LV
function, normal functioning mitral prosthesis, and thickened aortic valve with mild
aortic regurgitation. ECG normal with sinus rhythm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Bovine pericardium preserved in glutaraldehyde is one of the most widely used
biological tissues in cardiovascular surgery patches. The use of bovine pericardium
in cardiac surgery was introduced in 1972 by Ionescu et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> and popularized by Braile et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. In the present
case, it was used externally to the LV posterior wall to stem the bleeding caused by
rupture after mitral valve replacement. Roberts &#x00026; Morrow described the first two
cases of ventricular rupture; namely, rupture attributed to the weakness of the wall
by the withdrawal of leaflet calcification in one case, and in the other, the
perforation of the ventricular wall by excessive withdrawal of the papillary
muscle<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Patients most at risk are those who are older than 60 or those who are undergoing a
mitral valve reoperation.</p><p>The occurrence of ventricular rupture after the replacement of the mitral valve is
due to several factors<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. It can
be caused by improper selection of prosthesis that replaces the valve, especially in
elderly patients or female patients with little fibrous rings<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The prosthesis bigger than ring can cause local ischemia.
Usually, the prosthesis may depress mitral ring, creating a wall akinesia. These
akinetic region protrude out each systole, leading to a stretch of myocardial fibers
with overlapping vascular lesions. A hematoma is just formed in the region, raiding
the LV wall, resulting in an immediate rupture. Belatedly the presentation could
evolve to a ventricular dysfunction or even for an aneurysm<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Several techniques for ventricular
wall repair were described, with or without removal of the prosthesis. The surgeon
has to avoid take much calcium or fibrotic tissue at posterior ring. The posterior
ring has less fibrous tissue than anterior ring and it is more susceptible to
rupture.</p><p>Ventricular rupture can be classified as early, delayed, or late if the event occurs
at the time of surgery. It is most serious if the event is postoperative (usually in
the ICU) or years after surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Treatment of ventricular free wall rupture is essentially surgical. The first
described techniques for the containment of bleeding involved the use of deep points
in the myocardium, with the possible complication of circumflex artery injury, as
well as the difficulty in supporting the suture due to the fragility of the
ventricular cardiac muscle<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. To
reduce the possibility of these complications, another technique was described using
pericardium patch sutured internally on the ventricular injury<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. In the 1980s, techniques were
proposed using Teflon flaps, and subsequently, using biological glue, alternative
procedures were allowed to be used without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass.
There are reports in the literature of the use of bovine pericardium affixed with
biological glue for the treatment of ventricular wall rupture after myocardium
infarction<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. There are no
reports in the literature about the use of patches fixed with biological glue
without suture in cases of rupture after mitral valve replacement, as reported in
the present case. This is an alternative treatment that is both safe and effective.
That technique can be used in special cases when there isn't massive bleeding. It's
essential early diagnosis, before large muscular disruption or infiltration by
haematoma. Pericardial fixed with glue can avoid complete rupture of ventricular
wall. Considering that other techniques have poor prognosis, that strategies can be
an interesting alternative.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that the use of bovine pericardium fixed with biological glue on the
injured area in posterior wall rupture after mitral valve replacement proved to be
an effective alternative in the treatment of this highly lethal complication.</p><p>
