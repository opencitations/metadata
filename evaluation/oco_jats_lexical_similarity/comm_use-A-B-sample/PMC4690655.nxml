with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. However, in recent times the
transcatheter technique (TAVI) has emerged as a viable and effective alternative to
treat high risk or inoperable patients<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Nevertheless, inherent complications of TAVI has been surfacing and restricting its
use, such as the embolization of calcium debris and consequent cerebral infarction,
peripheral vascular damage, the further need of pacemaker insertion, paravalvular
leakage and its impact on long-term survival, coronary ostium occlusion, aortic
rupture and the high cost of the device<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Sutureless AVR using self-expanding bioprosthesis is a new and promising alternative
to standard AVR in elderly and high-risk surgical patients<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. The proposed benefits of
this technology include enhanced implantability, shorter aortic cross-clamp and
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times, favourable hemodynamic performance, and easier
access for minimally invasive surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.
In addition, this approach allows complete removal of the diseased native valve and
also comprises a suitable alternative to multiple valve procedures or associated
coronary artery bypass grafting. Several European case series have shown excellent
early clinical and hemodynamic outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.
Therefore sutureless aortic bioprostheses has been placed as an alternative to
standard surgical AVR or TAVI in elderly and high-risk patients.</p><p>Comparative reports in intermediate- to high-risk patients have demonstrate a lower
rate of perioperative complications and improved survival at 24-month follow-up with
sutureless valves compared to TAVI<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Therefore the objective of this study was to experimentally evaluate the implantation
of a novel balloon-expandable aortic valve with sutureless bioprosthesis in animal
model and report the early clinical application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>The Inovare Alpha bioprosthesis is made of a metallic structure of cobalt-chrome,
previously coated with a polyester fabric. This structure serves as a support for a
bovine pericardium valve, which is sutured with polyester yarn to this metal support
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The bioprosthesis is
encapsulated in a catheter for the positioning and deployment. The fixing of the
valve to the patient is given by the radial expansion force to the metal structure
exerts against the patient valve structures, pressure sufficient enough to
counterbalance the force exerted by blood flow.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The Inovare Alpha sutureless bioprosthesis (above) and the delivery catheter
(below).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-30-05-0515-g01"/></fig><p>The Inovare Alpha was evaluated in five animals (ovine) operated on in an
experimental operative room under routine hemodynamic monitoring and conducted as
usual in clinical cardiac surgical practice. The study was approved by the
Institutional Ethics Committee and all animals were treated according to ethical
principles of "National Research Council - Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources"
and those drawn-up by the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation (COBEA), along
with the local Ethics Committee on Animal Use.</p><p>Standard general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation were applied for all surgical
interventions. The animals underwent left thoracotomy and upon opening the
pericardium the cardiopulmonary bypass was established through cannulation of
carotid artery and left jugular vein. After aortic cross-clamping, myocardial
protection was achieved using intermittent cold blood cardioplegia. Transverse
aortotomy well above the aortic annulus enabled access to the aortic valve, the
leaflets were removed and the sutureless bioprosthesis was balloon expanded and
deployed to the aortic annulus, with 1/3 of the structure remaining on the left
ventricular face. CPB, aortic clamping and deployment times were recorded.
Echocardiograms were performed before, during and after the surgery. The initial
clinical application was performed in an 85 year-old patient with aortic stenosis
and high risk for conventional surgery, EuroSCORE 40% and multiple comorbidities
associated with active hepatitis C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Valve deployment was successfully performed in all cases. All valves were firmly
positioned without any migration. The sutureless bioprosthesis were rapidly deployed
(time ranging from 50 to 170 seconds; average: 95 seconds). The aortic clamping time
varied from 6-10 minutes, average of 7 minutes; the mean CPB time was 71 minutes.
Bioprostheses were properly positioned and secured to the aortic ring, as assessed
by transesophageal echo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). There were
neither paravalvular nor transvalvular leaks and excellent hemodynamic function was
observed in all cases. All coronary arteries remained patent, with no obstruction
determined by the device. Positioning and function were confirmed by autopsy in all
but one animal.</p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The deployment of the Inovare-Alpha in the experimental setting.</p><p>A=transverse aortotomy well above the aortic annulus and insertion of the

fully deployed and expanded, and there was no obstruction of coronary ostia in any
of the cases. The sutureless valves showed precise positioning in all cases with
good alignment to the aortic valve plane.</p><p>In the first patient operated on, the prosthesis was inserted and the aortic clamping
time was 39 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). The patient had
a good postoperative recovery and has currently been followed up for the hepatitis
C.</p><fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The clinical case.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-30-05-0515-g03"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study demonstrates that the implanted sutureless prosthesis proved to be
reliable and efficient, sitting and remaining well attached to the aortic valve
annulus with a fast procedure, as demonstrated by the short clamping time. The
performance of the prosthesis was also consistent, without paravalvar leakage,
migration, or damage to the surrounding tissues. These findings were confirmed by
the postmortem examination.</p><p>A good alignment of the device and the aortic valve plane was observed, and a fair
hemodynamic performance can be inferred because of the low profile and the optimized
opening area. No interference to the coronary arteries was seen, with the metallic
frame staying away from both ostia.</p><p>Surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) still represents the gold standard among the
therapeutical options in patients with severe aortic valve
stenosis<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Nevertheless, over the past few years, the possibility to treat high-risk or
inoperable patients with alternative approaches, such as the transcatheter technique
came out as a feasible and effective strategy with promising results. However,
inherent complications of this new technology as its increased costs, the lack of
removal of the calcified aortic valve and the resultant risk of paravalvular
leakage, coronary occlusion and aortic rupture have been recognized as important
limitations for TAVI<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. For these reasons, a number of sutureless aortic valve
bioprostheses have been developed to facilitate AVR and reduce the duration of
aortic cross-clamping time and its related adverse events<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The introduction of balloon-expandable sutureless bioprosthesis represents a step
forward and a novel device for treating intermediate- to high-risk patients with
severe aortic stenosis, with the reduction of aortic clamping and cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB), decreasing risks and adverse effects, also comprising a suitable
alternative to multiple valve procedures or associated coronary artery bypass
grafting. In addition, this approach allows complete or selective removal of the
calcified and diseased native valve, potentially averting particulated cerebral
embolism and cerebrovascular accident.</p><p>The concept of sutureless prosthetic heart valves led to the development of an array
of new generation of devices. Nowadays, three sutureless aortic bioprostheses are
currently available in Europe, the Perceval S (Sorin Group, Saluggia, Italy), the 3f
Enable (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and the Intuity (Edwards Lifesciences,
Irvine, CA, USA)<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This novel surgical prosthesis has been favourably compared with the TAVI approach in
recent series, thus offering a potential alternative to transcatheter in high-risk
patients. Several European case series have shown good outcomes of sutureless
compared to TAVI, with rather lower incidence of significant paravalvular
regurgitation, post-procedural pacemaker implantation and peripheral vascular
complications, along with better immediate postoperative survival<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The potential of shortening surgical times and improving overall patient outcomes may
expand the applicability of this simple and rapid implantation technique, as in long
and complex procedures (reoperations or combined procedures). Reduced implantation
and cross-clamping times will have a positive impact on the postoperative outcome of
high-risk patients undergoing long surgical procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Ranucci et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> reported that the aortic cross-clamp time
is an independent predictor of severe cardiovascular morbidity, with an increased
risk of 1.4% per 1-minute increase.</p><p>Associated with minimally invasive AVR, the sutureless approach can combine the
advantages of both techniques, as demonstrated by several recently published case
series that have shown excellent clinical and hemodynamic results<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Additionally, it represents a formidable alternative for valve in valve (aortic or
mitral), not only with failed bioprosthesis but also with mechanical valves, where
the direct approach allows the disk removal and the rapid insertion of the
sutureless valve.</p><p>Sutureless AVR is also an appealing option in several other specific circumstances,
such as redo procedures, as well as in the presence of porcelain aorta, calcified
aortic homograft, or small aortic annulus<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. And the additional breakthrough is the performance of
these procedures without the need of a hybrid room or a cath lab, being routinely
carried out in an ordinary operative room simply with the aid of a transesophageal
echo.</p><p>Consequently, the costs of sutureless are believed to be lower, as the price of TAVI
devices are higher and requires incremental costs related to prosthesis
implantation-related technology and to an increased number of personnel involved in
this procedure. A cost-utility analysis of TAVI in Belgium concluded that it is not
recommended to reimburse TAVI for high-risk patients because the patients had no
survival benefit after 1 year, the risk of cerebrovascular accident was twice as
high, and the costs were significantly higher<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Definitely further prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the long-term
durability and outcomes. The clinical trial testing these devices has been approved
and is currently underway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, the deployment of the sutureless bioprosthesis was safe and effective,
thereby representing a new alternative to conventional surgery or transcatheter in
moderate- to high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr style="border-bottom-style:solid; border-bottom-width:medium;border-top-style:solid; border-top-width:medium"><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold>Authors' roles &#x00026;
