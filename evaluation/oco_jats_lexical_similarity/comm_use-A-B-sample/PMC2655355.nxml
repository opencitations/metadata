A recent study linked a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs2814778) in the Duffy antigen/receptor chemokine gene (<italic>DARC</italic>) with white blood cell count. We therefore analysed the association of the rs2814778 CC, TC and TT genotypes with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) among asymptomatic women from the Caribbean, Europe and the United States. Among 261 study participants, 33/47 women from Barbados/Trinidad-Tobago, 34/49 from Haiti, 26/37 from Jamaica, and 29/38 US-born black women, but only 4/50 from the Dominican Republic and 0/40 US- or European-born whites (<italic>P</italic> = 0&#x000b7;0001) had the CC genotype. In a linear regression model that included percentage African ancestry, national origin, cytokines, socio-economic factors and the <italic>ELA2</italic> rs57834246 SNP, only the <italic>DARC</italic> rs2814778 genotype and C-reactive protein were associated with ANC (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;0001). Women with the CC genotype had lower ANC than other women. Further research is needed on the associations of rs2814778 genotype with neutropenia and treatment delay in the setting of cancer. A better understanding of these associations may help to improve cancer outcomes among individuals of African ancestry.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ethnic neutropenia</kwd><kwd>chemokines</kwd><kwd><italic>DARC</italic></kwd><kwd>African descent</kwd><kwd>genotype CC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>About 25&#x02013;40% of blacks in the United States are neutropenic; neutropenia is also prevalent in African and Afro-Caribbean populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Siebers <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bain, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Haddy <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bain <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Hsieh <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Grann <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Previous studies comparing Afro-Caribbean and African immigrants to people of African descent born in the United Kingdom found that both groups had similar white blood cell counts (WBC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and that both groups&#x02019; counts were lower than those of UK-born people of European descent. A study of white blood cell response to running a marathon, a reflection of release of neutrophils from bone marrow stores in response to cortisol, showed that runners of African ancestry had a smaller increase in WBC and ANC than white or Asian runners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bain <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). The WBC response to brief intense exercise, which reflects neutrophil demargination in response to catecholamine release, has also been found to be lower in people of African descent than in those of European descent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Phillips <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Diet, lifestyle and geographic location appear unlikely to explain the racial differences in leucocyte measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bain, 1996</xref>), but their biological causes are also not understood.</p><p>We recently found that women of African descent with early-stage breast cancer had lower baseline WBC and longer duration of adjuvant chemotherapy than non-Hispanic white women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Hershman <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Black women were more likely to miss cycles of chemotherapy and had poorer survival than white women. These observations raised questions about whether the prevalence of low WBC varied among ethnic subgroups and how WBC might be related to other biomarkers among women without cancer. Such biomarkers might also help to identify patients with sickle cell disease who would be at increased risk for neutropenia during treatment with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Brawley <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The gene that controls expression of the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (<italic>DARC</italic>), located on chromosome 1, has long been known to be associated with race.

US-born women were eligible if they were either black and had US-born parents, or white. For statistical purposes based on power calculations, we aimed to recruit 40 subjects per ethnic group. Participants represented a convenience sample recruited at Columbia University Medical Center in upper Manhattan or Long Island University in Brooklyn.</p><p>Women were screened for enrolment according to place of birth, age at immigration, primary language, current age and medical history. Women who reported a specific illness or disease-related symptoms were excluded from the study.</p><p>After obtaining informed consent, we asked the study participants to respond to a questionnaire about demographic and behavioural factors and health history and to provide a blood specimen. A phlebotomist performed venipuncture to obtain a 10 ml blood sample in a yellow-top tube (citrate). Subjects received financial compensation for their participation. Between October 2003 and February 2006, 276 women were enrolled; 13 were excluded because their questionnaire was lost, their blood sample had clotted, or their country of origin was not one of those included in the study; two were excluded because of human immunodeficiency virus infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory procedures</title><p>The Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) Biomarker Shared Resource and special hematology laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center performed all the analyses except for genotyping.

This study is, however, the first to show an association between the SNP and low ANC and to identify the association in subjects from the Caribbean as well as from the United States. Our findings also suggest that the low ANC phenotype may be recessive, given the lack of variability in ANC among women with the CC genotype. Women with the TC and TT genotypes had both higher and more variable ANC.</p><p>In a recent study of the same sample, clinical neutropenia was found in 12/171 women of African descent and 0/90 white and Dominican women with no reported explanatory medical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Grann <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Country of origin, <italic>ELA2</italic> rs57834246 genotype, and CRP, although not TNF-&#x003b1;, or G-CSF, were associated with ANC. The addition of <italic>DARC</italic> rs2814778 genotype to the model in the current study eliminated all those associations except for CRP.</p><p>The association observed in the current study between higher G-CSF and the <italic>DARC</italic> rs2814778 null homozygous genotype may reflect a feedback mechanism stimulated by low ANC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Semerad <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). G-CSF has been shown both to increase neutrophil production and to accelerate neutrophil entry into the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Price <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Individuals who lack DARC are resistant to <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria because the merozoite uses DARC to enter red cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Miller <italic>et al</italic>, 1976</xref>). Individuals who lack DARC on their red blood cells may still express it on their postcapillary venules, where it may interfere with leucocyte trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Peiper <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Kashiwazaki <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Nibbs <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism for the association of neutropenia with the <italic>DARC</italic> SNP is unknown. One possibility is that individuals who lack DARC, by which red cells absorb cytokines, are unable to modulate white cell trafficking; hence their neutrophils pool and keep the circulatory ANC low. Such a mechanism might also account for poor mobilization of white cells in response to exercise and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Phillips <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Hsieh <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). One other possibility includes a decrease of bone marrow reserve due to a deficiency of granulocyte&#x02013;macrophage colony-forming units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bain <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Rezvani <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Mice that were genetically engineered to lack DARC were unable to bind CXC chemokines, which promote tumorogenesis and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Lentsch, 2006</xref>). In a small study (<italic>n</italic> = 75) of human breast cancer pathological samples, high DARC expressors were less likely than low DARC expressors to have extensive lymph node metastases and had lower mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of this study is that it is based on a convenience sample of women in the ethnic groups of interest. Recruitment took longer for some groups than for others and may have been subject to unknown biases. However, it is difficult to see how bias could account for the association observed between ANC and genotype, neither of which could have been known to the study participants or us prior to the analysis.</p><p>Another limitation is that the WBC and ANC were analysed in healthy women. We still know nothing about the association of neutropenia with genotype in the setting of cancer or any other disease. However, the purpose of the study was to learn more about the association between the study markers and ethnicity in the absence of disease.</p><p>A third limitation is that the <italic>DARC</italic> rs2814778 genotype may be merely a surrogate marker for another gene that is similarly distributed in the populations studied. However, that SNP is the one most strongly associated with race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Nalls <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Further studies may consider other candidate genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first to show an association between the <italic>DARC</italic> rs2814778 CC genotype, common among individuals of African descent, and low ANC. The implications of this association for cancer patients and for those with sickle cell disease remain to be determined. For example, whether the effects of G-CSF as a treatment for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia among cancer patients, and of hydroxycarbamide as prevention for severe pain episodes among sickle cell patients(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Steinberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), vary by genotype needs to be determined. Further research may help to account for and prevent poor outcomes among persons of African ancestry and lead to interventions that may benefit them and all patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by U54 grants from NCI (CA101598 and CA101388); Dr Grann is the recipient of a grant from the American Cancer Society (RSGHP PBP-105710).
