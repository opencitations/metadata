The World Health Organization (WHO) is responding to emergencies in more than 30 countries. Last month, WHO joined partners at a conference in Lausanne, Switzerland to promote innovative solutions to humanitarian challenges as part of the Global Partnerships for Humanitarian Impact and Health initiative of the International Committee of the Red Cross. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.icrc.org/gphi2/about-gphi2/">http://blogs.icrc.org/gphi2/about-gphi2/</ext-link></p><fig id="Fa" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="BLT.16.010416-Fa"/><attrib>WHO/Kibnesh Chala </attrib></fig></boxed-text><sec><title>Protecting pregnant women </title><p>People living in areas affected by Zika virus should take measures to protect themselves from mosquito-bites and destroy mosquito habitats to prevent pregnant women becoming infected with Zika virus, according to WHO interim guidance issued last month. </p><p>Zika virus infection in pregnancy is typically a mild disease, but an unusual increase in cases of neurological disorders and neonatal malformations in areas where Zika outbreaks have occurred, has raised concern for pregnant women and their families.</p><p>WHO issued interim guidance on steps that national and local health managers can take when developing protocols and health policies related to pregnancy care in the context of Zika virus transmission.</p><p>&#x0201c;The importance of preventive measures should be emphasized [by health professionals] at every contact with a pregnant woman,&#x0201d; the guidance says. </p><p>These preventive measures include mosquito bednets, including when sleeping during the daytime; mosquito mesh/nets/screens on windows and doors; insect repellents and clothes that cover as much of the body as possible. </p><p>To prevent potential sexual acquisition of Zika virus during pregnancy, the sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas of ongoing Zika virus transmission, should, for the duration of the pregnancy, use condoms or adhere to other safe sexual practices, including abstinence, the guidance says.</p><p>In addition, safe sex practices are recommended for people infected with Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus, including consistent and correct use of condoms, for at least four weeks after onset of symptoms to avoid further spread of these infections, the guidance says.</p><p>The guidance also provides advice on the diagnosis and care of pregnant women with Zika infection. </p><p>

</p><p>Since the document was first issued in 2014, many new drugs have been licensed for hepatitis C virus infection and some of them were included in the latest <italic>WHO Model list of essential medicines</italic> released last year. </p><p>The updated guidelines for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection reflect these changes and include new evidence-based recommendations. </p><p>&#x0201c;These medicines are transforming the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, enabling the use of regimens that can be administered orally, [that] are shorter in duration (as short as eight weeks), [and that] result in cure rates higher than 90%, and are associated with fewer serious adverse events,&#x0201d; according to the updated guidelines. </p><p>The updated guidelines no longer recommend treatment with first-generation protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, as these two medicines are less effective than newer medicines and have more frequent adverse effects. </p><p>The updated guidelines also offer recommendations on the preferred and alternative regimens based on a patient&#x02019;s hepatitis C virus genotype and clinical history, such as whether patients have cirrhosis or not. </p><p>About 500 000 persons die every year as a result of hepatitis C virus-related complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis of the liver. </p><p>Hepatitis C virus infection can be cured by antiviral treatment, but the new drugs are unaffordable in many countries. Fortunately, prices are declining in some countries through the introduction of generics and negotiated price reductions with manufacturers. </p><p>Despite the fact that prices are falling, &#x0201c;the scaling up of treatment is likely to remain restricted in many countries because of the continued high prices of medicines and lack of health-care infrastructure,&#x0201d; according to the updated guidelines. </p><p>Hepatitis C is a bloodborne virus most commonly transmitted through the use of shared or unsterilized injection equipment and through unscreened blood transfusions. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/hepatitis-c-guidelines-policy/">http://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/hepatitis-c-guidelines-policy/</ext-link>
