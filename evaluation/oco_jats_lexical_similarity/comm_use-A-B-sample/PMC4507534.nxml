is a representative of aryloxyphenoxy propanoate (AOPP) herbicides. It is used to
control a wide range of grasses in wheat fields due to its high target selectivity
and low non-target toxicity (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">Bieringer <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1982</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Walia <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). However, research has shown that FE is harmful
to aquatic organisms (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">Asshauer <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1990</xref>). Consequently, the degradation of its residue is
attracting public attention.</p><p>In general, while FE and other AOPP analogs in the environment are degraded by both
abiotic and biotic processes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), microorganisms make the largest contribution.
AOPP herbicide-degrading microorganisms have been isolated from various genera,
including <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>,
<italic>Chryseomonas</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>,
<italic>Alcaligenes, Rhodococcus</italic>, <italic>Agromyces</italic>,
<italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic>, <italic>Aquamicrobium</italic>, and
<italic>Microbacterium</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Smith-Grenier

2011</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2013</xref>). The
degradation pathway of AOPP herbicides has also been investigated and proposed based
on metabolite identification. For example, <italic>Chryseomonas luteola</italic>
could degrade diclofop-methyl to diclofop acid and 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) phenol,
whereas <italic>Sphingomonas paucimobilis</italic> was capable of degrading diclofop
acid to 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) phenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol and (or) phenol (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Smith-Grenier and Adkins, 1996a</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Smith-Grenier and Adkins, 1996b</xref>). In addition,
<italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> converted FE to FA (fenoxaprop acid),
and FA was further transformed to CDHB (6-chloro-2,3-dihydrobenzoxazol-2-one) or
2-(4-hydroxyphen-oxy) propionic acid (HPP) in FE-TSB cultures (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Hoagland and Zablotowicz, 1998</xref>). <xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Hou <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> isolated an
FE-degrading bacterium <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> sp. T1, which could hydrolyze FE
to FA. CyB (Cyhalofop-butyl)-degrading strain <italic>Pseudomona
azotoformans</italic> QDZ-1 could hydrolyze the carboxylic acid ester linkage of
AOPP herbicides to their corresponding acid form (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Nie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. B2
could degrade clodinafop propargyl (CF) to clodinafop acid and
4-(4-Chloro-2-fluoro-phenoxy)-phenol (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Singh,
2013</xref>). To summarize, the initial step in the degradation of AOPP
herbicides, which is shared among these strains, is the breakdown of the carboxylic
acid ester bond by a carboxylesterase. Thus far, only two genes encoding this enzyme
have been cloned: <italic>chbH</italic> from <italic>Pseudomonas
azotoformans</italic> QDZ-1 and <italic>feh</italic> from
<italic>Rhodococcus</italic> sp. T1. However, the characteristics of FeH have
yet to be investigated.</p><p>In this study: JPL-2, an aryloxyphenoxy propanoate (AOPP) herbicide-degrading strain
of <italic>Rhodococcus ruber</italic>, was isolated and characterized; a novel
carboxylesterase gene <italic>feh</italic> was cloned and expressed; and the
characteristics of FeH were studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and media</title><p>The fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, cyhalofop-butyl, quizalofop-p-ethyl, diclofop-methyl,

The soil sample was collected from a wheat field in Henan province that had been
subjected to the long-term application of FE. Approximately 2.0 g of the soil

subjected to the long-term application of FE in the Henan province of China. We
identified the strain as <italic>Rhodococcus ruber</italic>. Some bacteria capable
of degrading AOPP herbicides have previously been isolated. For example,
<italic>Alcaligenes</italic> sp. H could degrade 45.8% of 100 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
fenoxaprop-p-ethyl within 5 d (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Song <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2005a</xref>). <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>
strains RA-2 and UA5-40 cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB) completely hydrolyzed FE
to FA within 5 d (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Hoagland and Zablotowicz,
1998</xref>). Six nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli utilized 1.5 mg
L<sup>&#x02212;l</sup> diclofop-methyl after 31 h of incubation at 25 &#x000b0;C.
<italic>Chryseomonas luteola</italic> completely degraded 1.5 mg L<sup>&#x02212;l</sup>
diclofop-methyl to diclofop acid and 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol within 71 h, and
<italic>Sphingomonas paucimobilis</italic> could mineralize 1.5 mg
L<sup>&#x02212;l</sup> diclofop-methyl to diclofop acid in 54 h (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Smith-Grenier and Adkins, 1996a</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Smith-Grenier and Adkins, 1996b</xref>).
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. Strain B2 was able to degrade 87.14% of 80 mg
L<sup>&#x02212;l</sup> clodinafop propargyl in 9 h (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2013</xref>). <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> sp. T1 could degrade 94% of
100 mg L<sup>&#x02212;l</sup> FE within 24 h (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Hou <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). <italic>Pseudomonas azotoformans</italic> QDZ-1
degraded 84.5% of 100 mg L<sup>&#x02212; l</sup> cyhalofop-butyl after 5 d of incubation
(<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Nie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).
Strain JPL-2 could degrade 94.6% of 100 mg L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> FE within 54 h and could
also use other AOPP herbicides like cyhalofop-butyl, quizalofop-p-ethyl,
diclofop-methyl, haloxyfop-p-methyl, fluazifop-p-butyl and clodinafop-propargyl as
substrates. In comparison with the reported strains, strain JPL-2 is not only
capable of rapid FE degradation but it is also a broad substrate degrader.</p><p>In general, the initial step of the metabolism of AOPP herbicides involves the
breakdown of the carboxylic acid ester bond. Strain JPL-2 hydrolyzed FE to FA and
ethanol, although the latter was not detectable by HPLC chromatography because
ethanol cannot absorb UV light. Ethanol could also be further used by strain JPL-2
(data not show). Currently, two genes encoding carboxylesterase have been cloned:
chbH, from <italic>Pseudomonas azotoformans</italic> QDZ-1 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Nie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), which was also able
to hydrolyze the AOPP herbicides, and <italic>feh</italic>. The <italic>feh</italic>
gene was first cloned from <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> sp. T1 (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Hou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), but the
characteristics of FeH were not extensively investigated. In the present study,
another <italic>feh</italic> gene was cloned from strain JPL-2, and the
characteristics of FeH were studied in detail. FeH from strain JPL-2 has 78%
similarity to that from <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> sp. T1, but it only exhibited a
10% similarity to ChbH. The Vmax of FeH was approximately 300 times that of ChbH
toward the substrate FE, and it has a broader substrate spectrum. However, FeH and
ChbH share a common characteristic: against the tested substrates, their enzymatic
activity decreased as the length of the aliphatic chain flanking the ester bond of
the AOPP herbicides increased.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Strain JPL-2 was isolated from the soil of a wheat field and identified as
<italic>Rhodococcus ruber</italic>. A novel carboxylesterase gene
(<italic>feh</italic>), enabling the strain to efficiently degrade AOPP
herbicides, was cloned from JPL-2. FeH from strain JPL-2 has a 78% similarity to
that from Rhodococcus sp. T1, but it only showed a 10% similarity to ChbH. FeH had a
broader substrate spectrum and higher catalysis efficiency than ChbH.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by The National High Technology Research and Development
